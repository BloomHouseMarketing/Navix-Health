              As a Business Associate under the Health Insurance Portability and
              Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), we are bound by the terms of our
              Business Associate Agreements with Covered Entities and by
              applicable federal and state privacy laws, including 42 CFR Part 2
              governing the confidentiality of substance use disorder patient
              records.

              4. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
              <strong>
                We use artificial intelligence ("AI") and machine learning
                ("ML") technologies to improve our products and services and to
                provide advanced functionality to Facilities. This section
                describes how we develop, train, and deploy AI/ML features.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.1 AI/ML Features</strong></p>
            <p>
              Our AI/ML capabilities include, but are not limited to: automated
              form completion and data extraction from clinical documents;
              clinical documentation assistance and suggestions; analytics,
              reporting, and decision support tools; quality improvement and
              outcome analysis; compliance monitoring and auditing assistance;
              and pattern recognition for operational efficiency.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.2 Training Data and Model Development</strong></p>
            <p>
              To develop and improve AI/ML features, we process information in
              the following ways:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> (a) : De-Identified Data.</strong> We use De-Identified Information
              (as defined in Section 5) to train, develop, test, and improve our AI/ML
              models. Because De-Identified Information does not identify any individual,
              it is not subject to the restrictions applicable to PHI under HIPAA
              or this Privacy Policy. Our use of De-Identified Information for AI/ML
              purposes does not require additional authorization from Facilities or
              patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> (b) : Aggregated Data.</strong> We aggregate information across
              multiple Facilities in de-identified form to identify patterns, develop
              benchmarks, train models on diverse data sets, and generate insights.
              This Aggregated Data cannot be used to identify any individual patient
              or specific Facility and may be used for any lawful purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> (c) : Facility-Specific Processing.</strong> With appropriate
              authorization under our Business Associate Agreement, we process Facility
              data to provide AI-powered features within that Facility's account (such
              as form auto-completion based on the Facility's own records). This processing
              occurs under the terms of our Business Associate Agreement and does
              not involve sharing identifiable data with other Facilities. patients.
            </p>
            <p><strong>4.3 AI/ML Safeguards</strong></p>
            <p>
              We implement the following safeguards for AI/ML processing: all
              training data undergoes de-identification before use in model
              training; we maintain technical and organizational measures to
              prevent re-identification; AI/ML models are designed to output
              predictions and suggestions, not to reproduce training data; we
              conduct regular audits of AI/ML systems for accuracy, bias, and
              privacy compliance; and Facilities retain control over whether to
              enable AI-powered features in their accounts.
            </p>
            <h3 class="pp-heading-3">
              5. De-Identification of Health Information
            </h3>
            <p>
              De-Identified Information" means health information that has been
              processed to remove identifiers such that the information does not
              identify an individual and there is no reasonable basis to believe
              the information can be used to identify an individual.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5.1 De-Identification Methods</strong></p>
            <p>
              We de-identify health information using methods consistent with
              HIPAA's Safe Harbor standard (45 CFR 164.514(b)(2)), which
              requires removal of the following categories of identifiers:
              names; geographic subdivisions smaller than a state; dates
              directly related to an individual (except year) including birth
              date, admission date, discharge date, and date of death; telephone
              numbers; fax numbers; email addresses; Social Security numbers;
              medical record numbers; health plan beneficiary numbers; account
              numbers; certificate/license numbers; vehicle identifiers and
              serial numbers; device identifiers and serial numbers; web URLs;
              IP addresses; biometric identifiers; full-face photographs and
              comparable images; and any other unique identifying number,
              characteristic, or code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we do not have actual knowledge that the remaining
              information could be used, alone or in combination with other
              information, to identify an individual.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5.2 Use of De-Identified Information</strong></p>
            <p>
              De-Identified Information is not Protected Health Information
              under HIPAA and may be used for any lawful purpose, including:
              AI/ML model training and development; product research and
              improvement; benchmarking and analytics; academic research and
              publication (in aggregated form); and industry reporting.
            </p>
            <p><strong>5.3 Re-Identification Prohibition</strong></p>
            <p>
              We do not attempt to re-identify De-Identified Information, and we
              contractually prohibit any third parties who receive De-Identified
              Information from us from attempting re-identification.
            </p>
            <h3 class="pp-heading-3">6. Data Retention</h3>
            <p><strong>6.1 Active Accounts</strong></p>
            <p>
              We retain information for as long as a Facility's account is
              active and as needed to provide Services. Facilities may request
              deletion of specific records in accordance with applicable law and
              our Business Associate Agreement.
            </p>
            <p><strong>6.2 Upon Termination</strong></p>
            <p>
              Upon termination of Services: we will retain data for a transition
              period as specified in our service agreement (typically 25 years)
              to facilitate migration to a new provider; after the transition
              period, we will securely delete or return PHI as directed by the
              Facility and in accordance with our Business Associate Agreement;
              we may retain De-Identified Information and Aggregated Data
              indefinitely for the purposes described in this Policy; and we
              will retain records as required by applicable law, including for
              audit, compliance, and legal purposes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>6.3 Backup and Archival Copies</strong></p>
            <p>
              Backup copies of data may persist in our systems for a reasonable
              period following deletion requests due to technical limitations of
              backup systems. Such backup data is protected by the same security
              measures as active data and is permanently deleted in accordance
              with our backup retention schedule.

              or Protected Health Information to third parties for their
              marketing purposes. Our use of De-Identified Information and
              Aggregated Data for internal product improvement purposes,
              including AI/ML model training, does not constitute a sale under
              applicable law because such data does not identify any individual.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9.2 Service Providers and Subcontractors</strong></p>
            <p>
              We may share information with third-party service providers who
              perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, data storage,
              payment processing, and customer support. These providers are
              bound by contractual obligations to protect information and, where
              applicable, are subcontractors under our Business Associate
              Agreements.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9.3 Legal Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>
              We may disclose information when required by law, regulation,
              legal process, or governmental request, or when we believe
              disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety
              or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a
              government request. Disclosures of substance use disorder records
              are made only in accordance with 42 CFR Part 2, which generally
              requires a court order.
            </p>
            <p><strong>9.4 Business Transfers</strong></p>
            <p>
              In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of
              assets, information may be transferred as part of that
              transaction. We will notify affected Facilities of any change in
              ownership or control and any choices they may have regarding their
              information.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p><strong>11.1 Consent Requirements</strong></p>
            <p>
              Except as permitted by 42 CFR Part 2, disclosure of substance use
              disorder records requires written patient consent that specifies:
              the name of the person or organization to receive the information;
              the purpose of the disclosure; how much and what kind of
              information will be disclosed; the patient's signature and date; a
              statement that consent may be revoked; and the date, event, or
              condition upon which consent expires.
            </p>
            <p><strong>11.2 Prohibition on Re-Disclosure</strong></p>
            <p>
              Information disclosed pursuant to patient consent is accompanied
              by a statement that federal law prohibits recipients from making
              further disclosure without additional patient consent or as
              otherwise permitted by 42 CFR Part 2.
            </p>
            <p><strong>11.3 De-Identification Under Part 2</strong></p>
            <p>
              Information that has been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA
              standards such that it does not identify a patient and there is no
              reasonable basis to believe it could identify a patient is not
              subject to the restrictions of 42 CFR Part 2. Our
              de-identification procedures are designed to meet this standard.

            <p>
              California residents have rights under the California Consumer
              Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA).
              However, HIPAA-covered health information processed by a covered
              entity or business associate is exempt from CCPA/CPRA. For
              personal information not covered by the HIPAA exemption,
              California residents have the right to: know what personal
              information is collected; request deletion of personal
              information; opt out of the sale or sharing of personal
              information; correct inaccurate personal information; and limit
              use of sensitive personal information. We do not sell personal
              information as defined under CCPA/CPRA. Our use of De-Identified
              Information does not constitute a sale because such information
              does not identify any individual.
            </p>

              patients in accordance with applicable law and with appropriate
