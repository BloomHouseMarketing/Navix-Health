                    > of the details of the dispute including your name, a
                    description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.  You

                    and use your best endeavors, in good faith, to resolve the

                  <p>
                    <strong>(c) Mediation.</strong>  Should the dispute not be

                    request the President of the Texas Association of Mediators
                    or the President’s nominee to select the mediator and
                    determine the mediator’s remuneration.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(d) Arbitration.</strong>  Should the dispute not be
                    finalized by mediation, an independent arbitrator may be
                    appointed under Texas Arbitration Law, with or without your
                    approval to determine the matter.  The arbitrator shall have
                    the power to decide any motions brought by the parties to
                    the arbitration, including motions for summary judgment
                    and/or adjudication and motions to dismiss and demurrers,
                    prior to any arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator shall have
                    the power to award any remedies, including attorneys’ fees
                    and costs, available under applicable law.  You and we
                    otherwise shall bear our own respective costs and expenses,
                    including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with any
                    arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in
                    writing.  Except as provided by law, arbitration shall be
                    the exclusive and final remedy for any dispute under these
                    Terms.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(e) Arbitration/Mediation Costs and Fees.</strong>
                     You and we will pay equal shares of the required and
                    reasonable costs and fees in a mediation or arbitration.  We
                    will not seek our attorneys’ fees and all our other costs in
                    the mediation or arbitration unless the mediator or
                    arbitrator finds that your claim is frivolous.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(f) Arbitration/Mediation Procedures.</strong>  The
                    mediation or arbitration may be conducted by telephone,
                    based on written submissions, video conference, or in person
                    at any mutually agreed location.  In an arbitration, all
                    issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues
                    relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of
                    this Section.  The amount of any settlement offer will not
                    be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after
                    the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(g) Exceptions.</strong>  This Section does not
                    require arbitration for the following claims: (i) individual
                    claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or
                    other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of
                    Navix Hub Professionals or intellectual property
                    infringement.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(h) No Class Actions.</strong>  Disputes shall be
                    brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought
                    as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
                    consolidated, or representative proceeding.  You agree not
                    to bring any matter by class arbitrations, class actions,
                    private attorney general actions, and consolidation with
                    other arbitrations.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in
                    a court rather than through mediation or arbitration, each
                    party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by
                    jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.  This does
                    not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide
                    settlement of claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(i) Severability</strong>.  If any part of this
                    Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the
                    remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of
                    partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or
                    representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be
                    unenforceable in its entirety.  Nothing in this Section will
                    be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek
                    public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right,
                    pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the
                    arbitrator.

                    billing information including a valid and authorized payment
                    method.  We will charge your payment method on the agreed

                    we may invoice you for such Taxes, excluding Taxes we pay on
                    the reportable net income we receive.  You agree to pay such
                    Taxes promptly and provide us with documentation proving the
                    payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably
                    require.  We use the name and address in your account
                    registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you
                    must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.

                    may be subject to an additional charge of 1.5% of the unpaid

                    <strong>(a) Confidentiality.</strong>  You may be given
                    access to our Confidential Information, our affiliates and
                    other third parties.  You may use Confidential Information
                    only as needed to use NavixAl as permitted under these

                    third party, and you will protect Confidential Information
                    in the same manner that you protect your own confidential
                    information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable
                    care.  Confidential Information means non-public information
                    that we or our affiliates or third parties designate as
                    confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential
                    under the circumstances, including software, specifications,
                    and other non-public business information.  Confidential

                    becomes generally available to the public (other than
                    through your conduct); (ii) you already possess without any
                    confidentiality obligations when you received it under these
                    Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party
                    without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you
                    independently developed without using Confidential
                    Information.  You may disclose Confidential Information when
                    required by law or the valid order of a court or other
                    governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written
                    notice to us and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope
                    of the disclosure, including assisting us with challenging
                    the disclosure requirement, in each case where possible.

                    must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain

                    represent to us that you are processing such data in

                    Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality,
                    Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9

                    <strong>(b) Effect of Termination.</strong> Upon

                    promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any
                    Confidential Information. The sections of these Terms which
                    by their nature survive termination or expiration shall
                    continue, including Sections 3 and 5 to 8.

                    <strong>(c) Limitations of Liability.</strong>  Neither we

                    mandatory alternative dispute resolution process and class
                    action waiver provisions unless you opt out of these

                    days of commencing use of NavixAI.

                  <p>
                    (b) Informal Dispute Resolution.  You agree to first try to
                    resolve any dispute or claim arising under these Terms
                    informally by first promptly providing us, and no later than
                    30 days from the date in which the issue in dispute arises,
                    with written notice at the.secretary@navixhealth.com of the
                    details of the dispute including your name, a description of
                    the dispute, and the relief you seek.  You will appoint a
                    person with authority to settle the dispute and use your
                    best endeavors, in good faith, to resolve the dispute.

                  <p>
                    (c) Mediation.  Should the dispute not be settled
                    informally, you may then seek to mediate the dispute in
                    accordance with the Texas Mediator Credentialing Association
                    Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics and should a named
                    mediator not be agreed, we shall request the President of
                    the Texas Association of Mediators or the President’s
                    nominee to select the mediator and determine the mediator’s
                    remuneration.

                  <p>
                    (d) Arbitration.  Should the dispute not be finalized by
                    mediation, an independent arbitrator may be appointed under
                    Texas Arbitration Law, with or without your approval to
                    determine the matter.  The arbitrator shall have the power
                    to decide any motions brought by the parties to the
                    arbitration, including motions for summary judgment and/or
                    adjudication and motions to dismiss and demurrers, prior to
                    any arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator shall have the
                    power to award any remedies, including attorneys’ fees and
                    costs, available under applicable law.  You and we otherwise
                    shall bear our own respective costs and expenses, including
                    attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with any
                    arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in
                    writing.  Except as provided by law, arbitration shall be
                    the exclusive and final remedy for any dispute under these
                    Terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (e) Arbitration/Mediation Costs and Fees. You and we will
                    pay equal shares of the required and reasonable costs and
                    fees in a mediation or arbitration.  We will not seek our
                    attorneys’ fees and all our other costs in the mediation or
                    arbitration unless the mediator or arbitrator finds that
                    your claim is frivolous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (f) Arbitration/Mediation Procedures.  The mediation or
                    arbitration may be conducted by telephone, based on written
                    submissions, video conference, or in person at any mutually
                    agreed location.  In an arbitration, all issues are for the
                    arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the
                    scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section.
                     The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to
                    the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator
                    determines the final award, if any.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (g) Exceptions. This Section does not require arbitration
                    for the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in
                    small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable
                    relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of NavixAI or
                    intellectual property infringement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (h) No Class Actions.  Disputes shall be brought on an
                    individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff
                    or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or
                    representative proceeding.  You agree not to bring any
                    matter by class arbitrations, class actions, private
                    attorney general actions, and consolidation with other
                    arbitrations.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in a
                    court rather than through mediation or arbitration, each
                    party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by
                    jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.  This does
                    not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide
                    settlement of claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (i) Severability.  If any part of this Section 8 is found to
                    be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in
                    effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or
                    unenforceability would allow class or representative
                    arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its
                    entirety.  Nothing in this Section will be deemed to waive
                    or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive
                    relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on
                    the substance of such claim from the arbitrator.

                    Terms, including in connection with a change of control.
                     Any purported assignment and delegation shall be null and
                    void.  We may assign these Terms in connection with a
                    merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of
                    our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of a corporate
                    reorganization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(e) Variation of Terms</strong>.  We may amend these
                    Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on our
                    website, or if an update materially adversely affects your
                    rights or obligations under these Terms, we will provide
                    notice to you either by emailing the email associated with
                    your account or providing an in-product notification.
                     Changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after
                    we notify you.  All other changes will be effective
                    immediately.  Your continued use of NavixAI after any change
                    means you agree to such change.  If you do not agree to the
                    change, you must cease use of NavixAI immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(f) Notices</strong>.  All notices from you to us
                    shall be in writing by email to
                    the.secretary@navixhealth.com.  We may notify you using the
                    registration information you provided to us or the email
                    address associated with your use of Navix Hub Professional.

                    <strong>(g) Waiver and Severability</strong>.  If you do not
                    comply with these Terms, and we do not take action
                    immediately, this does not mean we are giving up any of our
                    rights.  Except as provided in Section 8(i), if any part of
                    these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by
                    a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not
                    affect the enforceability of any other terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(h) Export Controls</strong>.  You represent and

                    and not on any such restricted party lists.  You must comply
                    with all applicable laws related to Embargoed Countries or
                    Restricted Party Lists, including any requirements or
                    obligations to know your end users directly.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(i) Equitable Remedies.</strong>  You acknowledge
                    that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause us
                    or our affiliates irreparable harm, and we shall have the
                    right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to
                    any other legal remedies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(j) Entire Agreement.</strong>  These Terms and any
                    policies incorporated in these Terms contain the entire
                    agreement between you and us regarding the use of NavixAI
                    and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements,
                    communications, or understandings between you and us.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(k) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law</strong>.
                     These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of
                    Delaware, without regard to Delaware conflicts of laws
                    rules.  Except as provided in the “Alternative Dispute
                    Resolution” section, all claims arising out of or relating
                    to these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or
                    state courts of Delaware, USA.

                    <strong>(l) Interpretation</strong>. The word “including”
                    means “including but not limited to”. Headings in these
                    Terms shall not affect interpretation of these Terms.
