                    to charge your payment method for the Fees.  Payment may be

                     You must provide one month’s notice of cancellation of your
                    account.  Should you continue to use Navix Hub Facilities
                    following the month of your notice of cancellation, you
                    shall continue to be liable for the Fees.  If your payment
                    cannot be completed, we may provide you written notice and
                    may suspend access to Navix Hub Facilities until payment is
                    received.  Fees are payable in U.S.  dollars and are due
                    upon the issue of an invoice or fees claim.  Payments shall
                    not be refunded except as provided in these Terms.  We
                    reserve the right to charge differential fees to users

                    must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.

                    they are posted, except for increases made for legal
                    reasons, which will be effective immediately.  Any price

                    immediately after the effective date of the changes.

                     You and we will pay equal shares of the required and
                    reasonable costs and fees in a mediation or arbitration.  We
                    will not seek our attorneys’ fees and all our other costs in
                    the mediation or arbitration unless the mediator or

                    <strong>(f) Arbitration/Mediation Procedures.</strong>  The

                    based on written submissions, video conference, or in person
                    at any mutually agreed location.  In an arbitration, all
                    issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues
                    relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of
                    this Section.  The amount of any settlement offer will not
                    be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after
                    the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.

                    <strong>(g) Exceptions.</strong>  This Section does not
                    require arbitration for the following claims: (i) individual
                    claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or
                    other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of
                    Navix Hub Facilities or intellectual property infringement.

                    <strong>(h) No Class Actions.</strong>  Disputes shall be
                    brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought
                    as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
                    consolidated, or representative proceeding.  You agree not
                    to bring any matter by class arbitrations, class actions,
                    private attorney general actions, and consolidation with
                    other arbitrations.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in
                    a court rather than through mediation or arbitration, each
                    party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by
                    jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.  This does

                    remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of
                    partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or
                    representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be
                    unenforceable in its entirety.  Nothing in this Section will
                    be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek
                    public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right,
                    pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the

                    and authorized payment method.  We will charge your payment
                    method on the agreed periodic basis, but we may reasonably
                    change the date on which the charge is taken.  You authorize

                    cannot be completed, we may provide you written notice and

                    access to our Confidential Information, our affiliates and
                    other third parties.  You may use Confidential Information

                    Information to any third party, and you will protect
                    Confidential Information in the same manner that you protect

                    information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to
                    the public (other than through your conduct); (ii) you

                    confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you independently
                    developed without using Confidential Information.  You may
                    disclose Confidential Information when required by law or
                    the valid order of a court or other governmental authority
                    if you give reasonable prior written notice to us and use
                    reasonable efforts to limit the scope of the disclosure,
                    including assisting us with challenging the disclosure
                    requirement, in each case where possible.

                    personal data, you must provide legally adequate privacy
                    notices and obtain necessary consents for the processing of
                    such data, and you represent to us that you are processing

                    limitations in this Section apply only to the maximum extent
                    permitted by applicable law. This limitation of liability is
                    an essential term of the contract between you and us
                    regarding your use of Navix Hub Professionals.

                    <strong>(a) Mandatory Resolution Process:</strong> You agree
                    to the following mandatory alternative dispute resolution
                    process and class action waiver provisions unless you opt
                    out of these alternative dispute resolution process terms,
                    by providing a notice in writing to<a

                  <p>
                    <strong>(b) Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>.  You agree
                    to first try to resolve any dispute or claim arising under
                    these Terms informally by first promptly providing us, and
                    no later than 30 days from the date in which the issue in
                    dispute arises, with written notice at <a
                      href='http://the.secretary@navixhealth.com'
                      >the.secretary@navixhealth.com</a
                    > of the details of the dispute including your name, a
                    description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.  You
                    will appoint a person with authority to settle the dispute
                    and use your best endeavors, in good faith, to resolve the
                    dispute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(c) Mediation.</strong>  Should the dispute not be
                    settled informally, you may then seek to mediate the dispute
                    in accordance with the <em
                      >Texas Mediator Credentialing Association Standards of
                      Practice and Code of Ethics</em
                    > and should a named mediator not be agreed, we shall
                    request the President of the Texas Association of Mediators
                    or the President’s nominee to select the mediator and
                    determine the mediator’s remuneration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(d) Arbitration.</strong>  Should the dispute not be
                    finalized by mediation, an independent arbitrator may be
                    appointed under Texas Arbitration Law, with or without your
                    approval to determine the matter.  The arbitrator shall have
                    the power to decide any motions brought by the parties to
                    the arbitration, including motions for summary judgment
                    and/or adjudication and motions to dismiss and demurrers,
                    prior to any arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator shall have
                    the power to award any remedies, including attorneys’ fees
                    and costs, available under applicable law.  You and we
                    otherwise shall bear our own respective costs and expenses,
                    including attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with any
                    arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in
                    writing.  Except as provided by law, arbitration shall be
                    the exclusive and final remedy for any dispute under these
                    Terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(e) Arbitration/Mediation Costs and Fees.</strong>
                     You and we will pay equal shares of the required and
                    reasonable costs and fees in a mediation or arbitration.  We
                    will not seek our attorneys’ fees and all our other costs in
                    the mediation or arbitration unless the mediator or
                    arbitrator finds that your claim is frivolous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(f) Arbitration/Mediation Procedures.</strong>  The
                    mediation or arbitration may be conducted by telephone,
                    based on written submissions, video conference, or in person
                    at any mutually agreed location.  In an arbitration, all
                    issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues
                    relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of
                    this Section.  The amount of any settlement offer will not
                    be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after
                    the arbitrator determines the final award, if any.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(g) Exceptions.</strong>  This Section does not
                    require arbitration for the following claims: (i) individual
                    claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or
                    other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of
                    Navix Hub Professionals or intellectual property
                    infringement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(h) No Class Actions.</strong>  Disputes shall be
                    brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought
                    as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class,
                    consolidated, or representative proceeding.  You agree not
                    to bring any matter by class arbitrations, class actions,
                    private attorney general actions, and consolidation with
                    other arbitrations.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in
                    a court rather than through mediation or arbitration, each
                    party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by
                    jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.  This does
                    not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide
                    settlement of claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(i) Severability</strong>.  If any part of this
                    Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the
                    remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of
                    partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or
                    representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be
                    unenforceable in its entirety.  Nothing in this Section will
                    be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek
                    public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right,
                    pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the
                    arbitrator.
                  </p>

                    Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on our
                    website, or if an update materially adversely affects your

                    comply with these Terms, and we do not take action
                    immediately, this does not mean we are giving up any of our

                    subject to your compliance with these Terms, we hereby
                    assign to you all its right, title and interest in and to

                    Content.  Breach of HIPAA, including all penalties, legal
                    fees and cost shall be entirely at your cost.  Use of terms

                  <p>
                    <strong>(a) Trial Period.</strong>  No fees are payable
                    during the designated trial period for use of NavixAI.
                     Unless otherwise specified in writing, the trial period is
                    14 days from establishing an account with NavixAI.  If we
                    believe you are not using the Trial period in good faith, we
                    may charge you standard fees or stop providing access to
                    NavixAI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(b) Fees and Billing</strong>.  You will pay all
                    fees charged to your account (“Fees”) according to the
                    prices and terms on the NavixAI pricing page, or as
                    otherwise agreed in writing.  We retain the right to correct
                    pricing errors even if we have already issued an invoice or
                    received payment.  You will provide complete and accurate
                    billing information including a valid and authorized payment
                    method.  We will charge your payment method on the agreed
                    periodic basis, but we may reasonably change the date on
                    which the charge is taken.  You authorize us and our
                    affiliates, and third-party payment processor(s), to charge
                    your payment method for the Fees.  Payment may be taken per
                    month in advance or on any other reasonable basis.  You must
                    provide one month’s notice of cancellation of your account.
                     Should you continue to use NavixAI following the month of
                    your notice of cancellation, you shall continue to be liable
                    for the Fees.  If your payment cannot be completed, we may
                    provide you written notice and may suspend access to NavixAI
                    until payment is received.  Fees are payable in U.S.
                     dollars and are due upon the issue of an invoice or fees
                    claim.  Payments shall not be refunded except as provided in
                    these Terms.  We reserve the right to charge differential
                    fees to users including Enterprise users.

                    do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes,
                    duties, and other similar assessments (“Taxes”).  You are
                    responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase, and
                    we may invoice you for such Taxes, excluding Taxes we pay on
                    the reportable net income we receive.  You agree to pay such
                    Taxes promptly and provide us with documentation proving the
                    payment, or additional evidence that we may reasonably
                    require.  We use the name and address in your account
                    registration as the place of supply for tax purposes, so you
                    must keep this information accurate and up-to-date.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(c) Price Changes.</strong>  We may change our
                    prices by posting notice to your account and/or to our
                    website.  Price increases will be effective 14 days after
                    they are posted, except for increases made for legal
                    reasons, which will be effective immediately.  Any price
                    changes will apply to the Fees charged to your account
                    immediately after the effective date of the changes.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(d) Disputes and Late Payments.</strong> If you
                    choose to dispute any Fees or Taxes, please email
                    the.secretary@navixhealth.com within thirty (30) days of the
                    date of the disputed invoice.  Undisputed amounts past due
                    may be subject to an additional charge of 1.5% of the unpaid
                    balance per month.  If any amount of your Fees is due, we
                    may suspend your access to NavixAI and provide you written
                    notice of late
                  </p>
                  <h3>5. Confidentiality, security and data protection</h3>

                    <strong>(a) Confidentiality.</strong>  You may be given
                    access to our Confidential Information, our affiliates and
                    other third parties.  You may use Confidential Information
                    only as needed to use NavixAl as permitted under these
                    Terms.  You may not disclose Confidential Information to any
                    third party, and you will protect Confidential Information
                    in the same manner that you protect your own confidential
                    information of a similar nature, using at least reasonable
                    care.  Confidential Information means non-public information
                    that we or our affiliates or third parties designate as
                    confidential or should reasonably be considered confidential
                    under the circumstances, including software, specifications,
                    and other non-public business information.  Confidential
                    Information does not include information that: (i) is or
                    becomes generally available to the public (other than
                    through your conduct); (ii) you already possess without any
                    confidentiality obligations when you received it under these
                    Terms; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to you by a third party
                    without any confidentiality obligations; or (iv) you
                    independently developed without using Confidential
                    Information.  You may disclose Confidential Information when
                    required by law or the valid order of a court or other
                    governmental authority if you give reasonable prior written
                    notice to us and use reasonable efforts to limit the scope
                    of the disclosure, including assisting us with challenging
                    the disclosure requirement, in each case where possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>(b) Security</strong>.  You must implement
                    reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help secure
                    your access to and use of NavixAI.  If you discover any
                    vulnerabilities or breaches related to your use of NavixAI,
                    you must promptly contact us and provide details of the
                    vulnerability or breach.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(c) Processing of Personal Data</strong>.  As your
                    use of NavixAI involves processing of personal data, you
                    must provide legally adequate privacy notices and obtain
                    necessary consents for the processing of such data, and you
                    represent to us that you are processing such data in
                    accordance with applicable law which includes but is not
                    limited to the Health Insurance Portability and
                    Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the California Consumer

                    when you first use NavixAI and remain in effect until you
                    cease use of NavixAI or we terminate this agreement.  You
                    may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason by

                    terminate these Terms for any reason by providing you at
                    least 30 days’ advance notice.  We may terminate these Terms
                    immediately upon notice to you if you materially breach
                    Sections 2 (Usage Requirements), 5 (Confidentiality,
                    Security and Data Protection), 8 (Dispute Resolution) or 9
                    (Miscellaneous), if there are changes in relationships with

                    promptly return or, if instructed by us, destroy any
                    Confidential Information. The sections of these Terms which

                    from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including

                    <strong>(b) Disclaimer.</strong>  NavixAI is provided “as
                    is.” Except to the extent prohibited by law, we, our
                    affiliates and licensors make no warranties (express,
                    implied, statutory or otherwise) with respect to NavixAI,
                    and disclaim all warranties including warranties of

                    and any warranties arising out of any course of dealing or
                    trade usage.  We do not warrant that NavixAI will be
                    uninterrupted, accurate or error free, or that any content
                    will be secure or not lost or altered. Your use of NavixAI
                    is completely at your own risk.

                  <p>
                    <strong>(c) Limitations of Liability.</strong>  Neither we
                    nor any of our affiliates or licensors will be liable for
                    any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or
                    exemplary damages, including damages for loss of profits,
                    goodwill, use, or data or other losses, even if we have been
                    advised of the possibility of such damages.  Our aggregate
                    liability under these terms shall not exceed the greater of
                    the amount you paid for the service that gave rise to the
                    claim during the month preceding the month in which the
                    liability arose or one hundred dollars ($100).  The
                    limitations in this section apply only to the maximum extent
                    permitted by applicable law. This limitation of liability an
                    essential term of the contract between you and us regarding
                    your use of NavixAI.

                  <h3>8. Alternative dispute resolution</h3>
                  <p>
                    (a) Mandatory Resolution Process: You agree to the following
                    mandatory alternative dispute resolution process and class
                    action waiver provisions unless you opt out of these
                    alternative dispute resolution process terms, by providing a
                    notice in writing to the.secretary@navixhealth.com within 30
                    days of commencing use of NavixAI.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (b) Informal Dispute Resolution.  You agree to first try to
                    resolve any dispute or claim arising under these Terms
                    informally by first promptly providing us, and no later than
                    30 days from the date in which the issue in dispute arises,
                    with written notice at the.secretary@navixhealth.com of the
                    details of the dispute including your name, a description of
                    the dispute, and the relief you seek.  You will appoint a
                    person with authority to settle the dispute and use your
                    best endeavors, in good faith, to resolve the dispute.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (c) Mediation.  Should the dispute not be settled
                    informally, you may then seek to mediate the dispute in
                    accordance with the Texas Mediator Credentialing Association
                    Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics and should a named
                    mediator not be agreed, we shall request the President of
                    the Texas Association of Mediators or the President’s
                    nominee to select the mediator and determine the mediator’s
                    remuneration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (d) Arbitration.  Should the dispute not be finalized by
                    mediation, an independent arbitrator may be appointed under
                    Texas Arbitration Law, with or without your approval to
                    determine the matter.  The arbitrator shall have the power
                    to decide any motions brought by the parties to the
                    arbitration, including motions for summary judgment and/or
                    adjudication and motions to dismiss and demurrers, prior to
                    any arbitration hearing.  The arbitrator shall have the
                    power to award any remedies, including attorneys’ fees and
                    costs, available under applicable law.  You and we otherwise
                    shall bear our own respective costs and expenses, including
                    attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with any
                    arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in
                    writing.  Except as provided by law, arbitration shall be
                    the exclusive and final remedy for any dispute under these
                    Terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (e) Arbitration/Mediation Costs and Fees. You and we will
                    pay equal shares of the required and reasonable costs and
                    fees in a mediation or arbitration.  We will not seek our
                    attorneys’ fees and all our other costs in the mediation or
                    arbitration unless the mediator or arbitrator finds that
                    your claim is frivolous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (f) Arbitration/Mediation Procedures.  The mediation or
                    arbitration may be conducted by telephone, based on written
                    submissions, video conference, or in person at any mutually
                    agreed location.  In an arbitration, all issues are for the
                    arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the
                    scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section.
                     The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to
                    the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator
                    determines the final award, if any.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (g) Exceptions. This Section does not require arbitration
                    for the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in
                    small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable
                    relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of NavixAI or
                    intellectual property infringement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (h) No Class Actions.  Disputes shall be brought on an
                    individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff
                    or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or
                    representative proceeding.  You agree not to bring any
                    matter by class arbitrations, class actions, private
                    attorney general actions, and consolidation with other
                    arbitrations.  If for any reason a dispute proceeds in a
                    court rather than through mediation or arbitration, each
                    party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by
                    jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim.  This does
                    not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide
                    settlement of claims.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (i) Severability.  If any part of this Section 8 is found to
                    be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in
                    effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or
                    unenforceability would allow class or representative
                    arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its
                    entirety.  Nothing in this Section will be deemed to waive
                    or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive
                    relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on
                    the substance of such claim from the arbitrator.
                  </p>

                     Any purported assignment and delegation shall be null and
                    void.  We may assign these Terms in connection with a

                  <p>
                    <strong>(e) Variation of Terms</strong>.  We may amend these
                    Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on our
                    website, or if an update materially adversely affects your

                     Changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after
                    we notify you.  All other changes will be effective
                    immediately.  Your continued use of NavixAI after any change
                    means you agree to such change.  If you do not agree to the
                    change, you must cease use of NavixAI immediately.
                  </p>

                    <strong>(g) Waiver and Severability</strong>.  If you do not
                    comply with these Terms, and we do not take action
                    immediately, this does not mean we are giving up any of our
                    rights.  Except as provided in Section 8(i), if any part of
                    these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by
                    a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not
                    affect the enforceability of any other terms.

                    that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause us
                    or our affiliates irreparable harm, and we shall have the
                    right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to
                    any other legal remedies.

                     These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of
                    Delaware, without regard to Delaware conflicts of laws
                    rules.  Except as provided in the “Alternative Dispute
