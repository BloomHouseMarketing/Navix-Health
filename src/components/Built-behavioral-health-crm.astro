      <strong>Admissions Teams Are Drowning in Manual Work</strong>
    </h2>
    <p class="subparagraph-nx">
      Your admissions coordinators shouldn't spend half their day stuck on hold with insurance companies. Every minute wasted on manual verification is a minute a patient waits for life-changing treatment. When referrals get lost in spreadsheets and leads slip through the cracks, you're not just losing revenue - you're missing opportunities to help people in crisis.
    </p>

    <p class="subparagraph-nx">
      Without unified behavioral health admissions software, your team operates in the dark. Marketing can't prove ROI. Admissions can't track conversion rates. Leadership lacks the visibility needed for strategic decisions. Meanwhile, competitors with modern systems are converting leads faster and growing smarter.
