        <strong>Admissions Teams Are Drowning in Manual Work</strong>
      </h2>
      <p class="subparagraph-nx">
        Your admissions coordinators shouldn't spend half their day stuck on
        hold with insurance companies. Every minute wasted on manual
        verification is a minute a patient waits for life-changing treatment.
        When referrals get lost in spreadsheets and leads slip through the
        cracks, you're not just losing revenue - you're missing opportunities to
        help people in crisis.
      </p>

      <p class="subparagraph-nx">
        Without unified behavioral health admissions software, your team
        operates in the dark. Marketing can't prove ROI. Admissions can't track
        conversion rates. Leadership lacks the visibility needed for strategic
        decisions. Meanwhile, competitors with modern systems are converting
        leads faster and growing smarter.

            Generic platforms like Salesforce Health Cloud require months of

            replace your entire clinical system. Navix is the optimal middle
