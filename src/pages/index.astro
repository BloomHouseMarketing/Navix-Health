Recognizing the difficulty of operational changes, we’ve designed Navix Hub™ to be highly intuitive and easy to learn. Data is seamlessly transferable from existing operating systems, reducing the friction in adoption and implementation."

      "text": "Navix Health comes pre-loaded with every form of documentation needed to run a facility or a private practice. The process for behavioral health facilities starts with identifying a super admin at your facility who is knowledgable of your work flow, we work through customizing the Navix software to meet your needs. Step two we train the staff and step three we go-live. Throughout the process we are available through a dedicated slack channel for questions and support. Navix also provides \"office hours\" after launch to answer staff questions and work through workflow challenges.

For our private practice users, we recommend setting up a zoom after you sign up for our software. The support team will help you dial in the software to meet your practice needs.

NavixAI is a turnkey software, however, we recommend meeting with the support team prior to using to help you get acquainted with the various AI tools."
