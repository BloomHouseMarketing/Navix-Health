        "content": "<p>Sliding scale fees offer flexibility, convenience, and accessibility to clients seeking mental health services. This pricing system is based on each client's ability to pay for treatment, and they can be fit into any therapy practice.</p><p>Whether you're in the preliminary stages of opening your mental health practice or evaluating your current fee structure, it's important to consider the logistics of offering a sliding scale. In this article, we'll review the benefits and drawbacks of reduced rates, special considerations you need to keep in mind, and how to set your rates.</p><h2><strong>Do Therapists Need to Offer a Sliding Scale?</strong></h2><p>No.</p><p>While some mental health professionals provide sliding scale rates, this is not a hard requirement. You should only offer a sliding scale if it aligns with your values, financial needs, and overall health of your practice.</p><p>Before offering a sliding scale, it's helpful to ask yourself:</p><ul><li>How many sliding scale slots do I intend to have?</li><li>How will I establish this rate?</li><li>How will I assess if the sliding scale is financially sustainable for my own well-being?</li><li>How will I adjust the sliding scale rate if needed?</li></ul><p>Therapists who opt to provide sliding scales generally value being able to provide more affordable therapy to a wider range of clients. Furthermore, if you're a newer clinician, you might offer sliding fee scales to build your initial caseload, increase your reach, and network more effectively.</p><h2><strong>Can You Offer a Sliding Scale If You Accept Insurance?</strong></h2><p>In most cases, you can offer sliding scale rates if you accept insurance, but you must be aware of some inherent caveats, including:</p><h3><strong>Insurance Contracts</strong></h3><p>Every insurance panel requires you to sign a contract agreeing to their specific policies and set rates for covered services. These contracts typically prohibit therapists from charging a therapy cost that is more or less than this fixed rate.</p><p>Therefore, offering a reduced fee to insured clients may be perceived as \"fee-forgiving,\" potentially violating the contract. You could be at risk for insurance fraud, so make sure to review your contracts carefully.</p><h3><strong>Non-Covered Services</strong></h3><p>In most cases, you can offer sliding scale therapy services if such services aren't covered by your client's insurance plan. For example, if their health insurance doesn't cover couples therapy, you can provide a sliding scale fee for that specific service.</p><h3><strong>Out-of-Network Healthcare Providers</strong></h3><p>You may still be able to offer sliding scale services as an out-of-network (OON) provider. In this case, the client may <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/therapy-superbill-everything-you-need-to-know>use superbills</a> to receive direct reimbursement. Your client pays you the reduced fee, and they submit the claims to their insurance company. With that, insurance may only reimburse them based on a percentage of your standard fee- not the sliding scale cost.</p><h3><strong>Medicare and Medicaid Compliance</strong></h3><p>Medicare and Medicaid are government payers and have specific billing guidelines. You may not be able to offer sliding scale fee structures for any of these individuals. Confirm with your specific contracts in advance.</p><h2><strong>Should You Require Income Verification for Sliding Scale Clients?</strong></h2><p>It's not mandatory, and it's important to understand the pros and cons of asking clients to provide proof of their limited financial resources. On the one hand, income verification can ensure a sense of accuracy and objectivity. This may prevent clients with more adequate resources from taking advantage of you offering lower rates.</p><p>On the other hand, income verification can feel intrusive. Trust is an essential part of any therapeutic relationship, but money is often a private and even taboo matter. Clients may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed to show you the specifics of their financial situation.</p><h2><strong>How to Calculate Your Sliding Scale Fee Structure</strong></h2><p><strong>Define your standard fee:</strong> Before establishing any sliding scale therapy, you need to clearly identify your standard session fee. This is the rate your full-fee clients will pay, and this is typically the <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make>rate you will advertise</a>.</p><p><strong>Define your ideal monthly or annual salary:</strong> Although this may be a ballpark number, it will help you evaluate how much income you need to earn.</p><p><strong>Review your monthly and annual expenses:</strong> Your profit refers to the net income you earn after accounting for any expenses. This number may fluctuate, but you should have a clear understanding of what you're taking home regularly. This will help you determine whether a sliding scale is feasible for your practice, and it will also help you average out your various offerings.</p><p><strong>Determine your ideal number of clients you want to see each week:</strong> How many slots will you have available, and how many days per week do you intend to work? Fees may feel much different for a therapist seeking a part-time income of 10 hours per week rather than a breadwinner fully supporting their family with their therapy practice.</p><p><strong>Consider your sliding fee structure:</strong> Some therapists offer tiers for their sliding scales. For example, you might offer a set discount for clients with some financial challenges. You might also offer a more significant discount for your lowest-income earners. Other therapists build a more structured sliding scale pricing based on income brackets.</p><p><strong>Designate how many sliding scale slots you will have at a given time:</strong> To avoid your own financial burden, it's important to establish how many reduced fees you will offer for clients. This number may fluctuate based on your own income and various life circumstances.</p><h2><strong>Legal and Ethical Considerations for Your Sliding Fee Scale</strong></h2><p>If you opt to honor a sliding scale, it's essential to determine this fee at the onset of therapy. However, you might also choose to adjust session fees if a client suddenly experiences financial hardship or other circumstances change.</p><p><strong>Maintain <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/burnout-and-clinical-documentation-how-to-streamline-paperwork>clear documentation</a>:</strong> Indicate your rationale for offering a sliding scale and define when fees will be revisited or renegotiated. If you require proof of a client's income, be sure to keep a clear copy of this in their file.</p><p><strong>Beneficence and client welfare:</strong> Mental health professionals strive to do no harm and act in their client's best interest. Sliding scale services help people afford therapy if they can't use their insurance or other means. Therefore, in most cases, sliding scale therapy options align well with professional licensing boards.</p><p><strong>Informed consent:</strong> Clearly discuss your sliding scale option at the beginning of therapy. Clients must be aware of how rates are determined and when their rates may be reevaluated. Consent may need to be revised regularly, particularly if their financial situation changes.</p><h2><strong>Alternatives to Sliding Scale Therapy</strong></h2><p>Sliding scales aren't the only option for therapists. Here are some other ways to give back to the community by lowering therapy costs:</p><p><strong>Offer reduced mental health services through a directory or by paneling with insurance:</strong> If you feel concerned about setting your own fees or managing those logistics, consider advertising your services on a platform like <a href=https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&ai=DChcSEwiD3-Xegd-JAxU0KEQIHd_-JxoYABAAGgJkeg&ae=2&aspm=1&co=1&ase=2&gclid=Cj0KCQiA_9u5BhCUARIsABbMSPubXl5dcLI9WqgMciY-WJQkkhjVOtG10b7PoMaupde4e3oYDbnHEUoaAufoEALw_wcB&ei=GZk3Z9fWCcTPkPIPopr-yAM&ohost=www.google.com&cid=CAESVuD2Dh32-EqWyIrkU0aUbhzoyLKpcKM8KjHuBO-9ujK_Dmf9P6zQ_py9YnqlhnX_81fq6biTdIB4l45UTbHFU8Ad3HIcu1V8W12IADz3ZNK2CeYb71V1&sig=AOD64_0CDC0ZPdmm4AXA8SwNKYADlTIE6Q&q&sqi=2&nis=4&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwiXx-Degd-JAxXEJ0QIHSKNHzkQ0Qx6BAgKEAE>Open Path Collective</a>. Or, you may consider <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/accepting-insurance-in-private-practice-definitive-pros-and-cons>paneling with a few insurance companies</a> to increase accessibility.</p><p><strong>Adhere to a pay-what-you-can model:</strong> Pay-what-you-can therapy session costs are determined by the client instead of the therapist. At the beginning of therapy, you inquire about the client's ability to pay for treatment and honor that rate indefinitely (or when their financial situation changes).</p><p><strong>Pro Bono therapy:</strong> This refers to free therapy, and some therapists reserve a few slots for this type of service in their practice.</p><h2><strong>Streamlining Your Finances and Private Practice With Navix Health</strong></h2><p>At Navix Health, we are dedicated to helping mental health providers optimize their business and reduce their administrative burden.

Regardless of where you are in your career, it's typical for therapists to consider how and when they should grow their practices. That said, it's important to be aware of the risks and benefits and know which steps to take to ensure your success.<p>In this article, we'll dive into what you need to know and provide action-based tips for optimizing your scaling strategy. At Navix Health, we can support your professional growth at every stage- from first opening your practice to continually expanding your expertise and growing your client base.<h2><strong>What Does It Mean to Scale Your Private Practice?</strong></h2><p>Scaling your private practice refers to expanding beyond just a sole practice. There are many ways to scale your practice, but you might consider some of the following options:<p><strong>Hiring additional clinicians:</strong> Some therapists shift from maintaining individual private practices into operating group practices. State laws vary on how to compensate and hire therapists. For instance, in some states, they can be classified as independent contractors, but in others, you need to classify them as W2 employees.<p><strong>Opening different locations:</strong> Scaling can also refer to geographical growth. Your practice may have outgrown its current office space, and you may seek to serve other professionals or communities.<p><strong>Offering different services or income streams:</strong> Instead of seeing clients just for therapy, you might also expand services to include other revenue streams, including offering supervision, consultation, teaching, speaking or other professional tasks.<h2><strong>Benefits of Scaling Your Practice</strong></h2><p>In any industry, scaling comes with numerous advantages. As a therapist, scaling may mean spending more time on tasks that you genuinely prefer. It might also lead to a <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life>greater work-life balance</a> and more financial freedom.<h3><strong>Increased Income</strong></h3><p>Most private practice owners scale their businesses because they want to enhance their revenue potential. This becomes particularly incentivizing when you only work fee-for-service. For example, when you're sick or traveling, you don't get paid. Creating systems where you still earn money can dramatically impact your cash flow by:<ul><li>Having more billable hours: If you have other therapists working for you, your practice can take on more clients, resulting in more billable hours and more revenue.<li>Offering specialized treatments and services: Expansion may encourage you to offer more expensive services (<a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-tips-for-running-better-group-therapy-sessions>group therapy</a>, consultation groups, intensives) that may attract more clients.<li>Passive income streams: Your scaling strategy may include passive income streams, including making digital courses, online trainings, books, and more. Although these items require upfront time and money, there can be massive potential for earning more money over a sustained amount of time.</ul><h3><strong>Access to More Clients</strong></h3><p>If your focus is on increasing accessibility, scaling offers you the ability to expand your reach in your community. When you have a bigger team, you have more resources, knowledge, and support to offer potential clients.<p>You may be able to access more clients via:<ul><li>Offering groups (group therapy, supervision groups, consultation groups)<li>Accepting insurance and/or Medicare/Medical<li>Engaging in community-based training or outreach<li>Hosting on-site workshops</ul><h3><strong>Business Stability</strong></h3><p>When you run your own practice, your income is directly proportional to the number of hours you see clients. This isn't inherently problematic, but it limits how much control you have over your time. Furthermore, it can be tricky if you want to travel, take parental leave, or have other forms of absences.<p>When the business can run without just you manning every task, you can enjoy more freedom and flexibility.<h3><strong>Opportunities for Mentorship or Leadership</strong></h3><p>Scaling may open opportunities to embody more of a leadership role, which can feel both rewarding and enriching for therapists. This may continue benefiting your practice by:<p><strong>Improving your professional reputation:</strong> Scaling your practice can strengthen your public image and inherently boost your marketing efforts. This, in turn, can lead to even more growth opportunities in the future.<p><strong>Strengthening your professional skills:</strong> Leadership forces you to grow and expand your knowledge. In addition to providing care for clients, leadership requires utilizing many other skills, including problem-solving, conflict resolution, attunement, assertiveness, and crisis intervention.<h3><strong>Manage or Prevent Burnout</strong></h3><p>Direct clinical work can become draining for even the most dedicated therapists. Scaling shifts you away from just one role (being a therapist) and allows you to engage in different skills and strategies.<p>Some people find they love managing the business side of operating a practice, and others discover new passions in training, mentoring, or supervising. All of this can keep you feeling rejuvenated and inspired.<h2><strong>Risks of Scaling Your Practice</strong></h2><p>Scaling your practice isn't always a straightforward process. Many therapists can attest to the growing pains and struggles associated with taking risks or expanding their services.<h3><strong>Increased Administrative Tasks</strong></h3><p>At first, you will likely be spending more time on your business than you ever have before. You might be juggling networking events, onboarding tasks, accounting work, and more. You might be doing this all while managing a high caseload. Staying focused can feel challenging, and it may bleed into your ability to still provide high-quality care to your current clients.<h3><strong>Higher Operational Costs and Risks</strong></h3><p>Growth usually means more upfront money. This is inherently risky, and the financial market can change at any given moment. In addition, there's generally a trial-and-error process associated with any expansion. Instead of doing things the way you've always done, you'll need to employ new tools and processes- some of which may not be lucrative.<h3><strong>Management Struggles</strong></h3><p>Hiring the wrong team member can drain your resources, money, and even your reputation. It's essential to be aware of this risk, particularly as you start delegating different work.<p>Moreover, some therapists realize that, even though they really enjoy their clinical work, they don't particularly enjoy managing other professionals. If you’re concerned about management, consider scaling slowly to see how it feels. You may even consider starting by just outsourcing a few tasks to a <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/28-ways-a-virtual-assistant-can-support-your-mental-health-practice>virtual assistant</a> to gain a rhythm for delegation.<h2><strong>Tips for Growing Your Practice in a Sustainable Way</strong></h2><p>Having great ideas is one thing, but building a successful practice requires both time and effort. Here are some proactive strategies for scaling.<h3><strong>Establish Your Main Goals</strong></h3><p>To successfully scale your practice, you need to have a clear strategic process of why and how you intend to expand. What are your main priorities right now? Do you want to make more money? Grow your professional reputation? Offer more mental health services to more clients?<p>Having a main goal in mind keeps you organized and focused as you start planning your next steps. As you create a vision for how you intend to scale, consider which roadblocks you might encounter. How will you maintain a sense of regulation and optimism when things inevitably become challenging? Where will you seek support when you feel overwhelmed?<h3><strong>Audit Your Finances</strong></h3><p>There's no \"right\" time to expand your practice. However, you should have a strong understanding of your financial situation. Scaling requires upfront time and money- to make this growth a success, you need to truly understand the financial implications you're absorbing.<p><strong>Plan for ongoing cash flow management:</strong>You want to ensure you have enough capital to sustain your practice during the growth phase. This doesn't mean avoiding debt altogether (that may be inevitable). But you want to make sure you know your numbers and can account for them as you bring on new staff or absorb more costs.<p><strong>Assess your profit margins:</strong> Instead of simply looking at the gross income potential, you want to consider your profit margins. How much time, for instance, will it take to see a return on your initial investment? How much do you anticipate making per month or year compared to what you make now?<p><strong>Speak to an accountant:</strong> A professional CPA can help you better navigate your cash flow, business structure, tax situations, and more. Although you can certainly DIY your accounting, most therapists find it's better to outsource some of these tedious and complex tasks to a professional.<h3><strong>Hire the Right Staff</strong></h3><p>Your staff can truly make or break your business, and the success of your scaling largely depends on the people you bring on. Most importantly, take your time. Don't rush to hire someone or build a team haphazardly.<p>While there's no perfect formula for hiring team members, most people find that it's beneficial to engage in a thoughtful interview process. Take time to really get to know the people you might be hiring and don’t overlook the merit of having a preliminary trial period with new hires.<h3><strong>Honor the Challenges of the Growth Phase</strong></h3><p>As a therapist, you already know that change is hard, even when that change is positive or desired. Anything can happen, and it's key to stay grounded as you move through the ups and downs of this transition.<p>The growth phase is full of various challenges, but it can also be so exciting and inspiring. Try to hold onto that beacon of hope- even during the hard moments.<h2><strong>How Navix Health Can Optimize Your Practice</strong></h2><p>At Navix Health, we value therapists <a href=https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-really-maximize-your-time-15-productivity-tips-for-therapists>spending time</a> on what matters most to them.

At Navix Health, we're dedicated to staying on the front lines of optimizing healthcare management. Prioritizing these essentials allows you to prioritize what matters most to you: your clinical presence and relationships with patients.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Clinical Administrative Pain Points</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Before diving into all the benefits of AI, it's important to validate the many issues associated with our current healthcare system. Some of the main ones include:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Excessive time spent on documentation: </strong>Updating treatment plans, writing progress notes, and entering medical data for insurance claims can take <em id=\"\">hours </em>a day. If you fall behind, documentation can feel even more overwhelming.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Insurance compliance: </strong>Many healthcare professionals can relate to the anxiety associated with ensuring that their documentation adheres to the standards required by various insurance companies. Mistakes can be costly, leading to rejected claims, <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/best-practices-for-navigating-insurance-audits-in-private-practice\" id=\"\">audits</a>, or clawbacks.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Frustrating user interfaces: </strong>Unfortunately, many EMR platforms aren't intuitive, meaning you're spending extra time on administrative tasks and questioning if you're missing something crucial.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Harnessing AI Tools for Healthcare Professionals</strong></h2><p id=\"\">AI has unquestionably changed nearly every industry. Regardless of your personal thoughts or fears associated with it, it's important to have transparent information about its offerings. Here are just a few examples of how AI is saving professionals time and money.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Administrative Automation</strong></h3><p id=\"\">As mentioned, documentation represents one of the greatest pain points among healthcare professionals. Fortunately, our EHR system offers multiple streamlined options for reducing the time you spend taking notes or engaging in treatment planning.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Automated reminders: </strong>You can set up automatic reminders about upcoming sessions, billing needs, and paperwork requests. This streamlined option may reduce no-shows, thereby leading to better patient outcomes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Enhanced medical coding: </strong>AI can ensure that the data entry within your medical records adheres to all coding requirements, decreasing the risk of claim rejections.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Natural Language Processing</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Natural language processing (NLP) transcribes your session notes directly from voice-to-text software or audio transcriptions.</p><p id=\"\">Although it may sound complicated, it's incredibly easy: you simply provide the summary of crucial points, and AI generates compliant, effective notes via speech recognition software. Our NLP is sophisticated enough to interpret even the more complex nuances of clinical jargon, recognizing terms like \"trauma symptoms\" or\" anxiety\" and adequately inputting them into your clinical documentation.</p><p id=\"\">Some of the main benefits of NLP include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>improved <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-write-clinical-notes-faster\" id=\"\">documentation speed</a> and <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\">documentation effectiveness</a></li><li>reduced cognitive load (less time spent thinking about the \"right thing to say\")</li><li>enhanced compliance with industry standards and insurance requirements</li></ul><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Improved Treatment Team Communication</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If you work within a milieu-based setting or coordinate with other healthcare professionals, effective communication remains a top priority.</p><p id=\"\">AI-powered EMRs offer distinct advantages, including:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Alerting: </strong>AI tools can generate necessary alerts for sensitive information and inform practitioners of potential clinical concerns (i.e. notifying them about medication interactions).</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Personalized treatment plans: </strong>AI operates via machine learning algorithms. <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/implementing-ai-and-machine-learning-in-behavioral-health-management\" id=\"\">Machine learning </a>inputs suggest beneficial diagnostic screens or predictive analytics based on patient medical information and clinical progress.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Guidelines compliance: </strong>AI can streamline communication within larger healthcare systems. They can help ensure all team members adhere to appropriate clinical standards and best practices. This generally translates to better patient safety and improved patient outcomes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Resource allocation: </strong>AI can also interpret management and cash flow within healthcare organizations. This can improve staffing and resource use based on these predictions. In turn, this may cut down on excessive healthcare costs for both patients and practitioners.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">AI and Legal and Ethical Considerations</strong></h2><p id=\"\">If you feel wary about implementing AI into your practice, you're certainly not alone. Many healthcare providers have valid concerns about how AI may disrupt their careers.</p><p id=\"\">While AI is transforming many facets of treatment, it's unlikely it can ever truly replace the need for effective human therapists. Instead, AI is a tool that you can <em id=\"\">leverage </em>to your advantage. However, it's important to be aware of the risks and understand how to mitigate them from adversely impacting you or your patients.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Data security: </strong>Before using any AI-based tool, it's important to check their security protocols. HIPAA compliance always matters, and you should know how patient data is collected, stored, and processed. Ensure that communication between you and your clients is encrypted and make sure your <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/are-you-missing-these-crucial-elements-in-your-therapist-informed-consent-forms\" id=\"\">informed consent and privacy policies</a> outline how you use AI in your practice.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Effective training:</strong> It's imperative that professionals feel equipped to use tools effectively. If you oversee or are responsible for hiring clinicians, consider how you can create a structured AI training program for employees. Incorporate case studies or shadowing to show how you (or other professionals) have successfully integrated various AI tools into your work.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Need for human oversight: </strong>Ethically, you are responsible for ensuring that AI tools support your work without undermining or replacing it. You are a <em id=\"\">human </em>first, and your expertise and presence matter to patients. While AI algorithms may predict patient outcomes or provide a useful note, you are fully accountable for making sure it resonates with the work you do and the people you work with.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Optimizing Your Practice With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we believe clinicians deserve an optimal electronic health record that works <em id=\"\">for </em>them.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Mental health professionals spend their days looking after the needs and emotions of others. As a therapist, you sit with clients' pain regularly. You help them cope with their stress, strengthen their relationships, and improve their well-being. The work, as you know, can be as taxing as it is rewarding.</p><p id=\"\">But how do <em id=\"\">you </em>recharge at the end of the day? How do you practice your own self-care to ensure your needs are also met?</p><p id=\"\">Taking a vacation in private practice may feel like a luxury- especially if you're worried about playing catch-up, abandoning clients, or even financially absorbing the risk of being absent from your work.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Ethically Take Vacations in Private Practice</strong></h2><p id=\"\">All therapists know that prioritizing self-care and personal wellness is important for prioritizing their mental health and mitigating the risk of<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/burnout-and-clinical-documentation-how-to-streamline-paperwork\" id=\"\"> professional burnout</a>. But taking time off for yourself may be easier said than done.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some strategies to keep in mind to ensure things go smoothly:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Plan Early in Advance</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The earlier you can plan for your vacation, the better. Aim to start planning your vacation days well in advance and block them out on your calendar. Inform your clients you will be out of office at least two weeks (if not longer) before you head out. Consider that some clients may want extra sessions just before or after you return. Document any specific client reactions about your vacation plans.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Make a Plan With Clients</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Clients need to know where to turn if a crisis occurs. Identify a trusted colleague who can handle any emergencies that may happen in your absence. If possible, offer resources, including immediate coping strategies and numbers to crisis hotlines, for clients to access while you're away. In session, make space for your clients to share their feelings about your absence- some will openly talk about their concerns, whereas others may be more covert. Regardless of how they present, you want to do your part to ensure clients feel cared for and supported.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Decide What You Want to Disclose</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Self-disclosure is both a subjective and controversial part of therapy. Some therapists share very little information about themselves. Other providers are far more candid and transparent. Neither approach is inherently better than the other.</p><p id=\"\">However, you should consider how you want to answer questions about your absence. For example, clients may ask where you're going, who you're going with, and what you plan to do while you're away. Think about what you want to share and identify any potential risks associated with such disclosures.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consult with a Colleague for Coverage</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Some clients may need ongoing care during your absence. If you share relevant clinical information with a colleague, make sure those details comply with state confidentiality laws and ethics. Obtain a release of information from your client and document the conversation you have about continuity of treatment.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Maintain Your Professional Boundaries</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Running a business can be as exciting as it is stressful. Some therapists feel responsible for their clients 24/7. They feel they must respond to every message or need right away.</p><p id=\"\">This can create problems- both for you and your clients. You’re entitled to take time off, and it’s important to aim to resist the urge to check work emails or voicemails while you're away. Trust your contingency plans and allow yourself to enjoy the hard-earned break.</p><p id=\"\">With that, set up automated responses indicating you're out of the office and update your voicemail greeting listing your vacation dates and emergency contact information.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ease Yourself Back Into Work</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If possible, plan to return home 1-2 days before seeing clients. This allows you time to settle in emotionally, check your emails, and review your schedule before diving back into therapy. It also accounts for any last-minute travel snags, including delayed flights or jet lag.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Double-Check Your Consent Forms</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It's a good practice to review your<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/are-you-missing-these-crucial-elements-in-your-therapist-informed-consent-forms\" id=\"\"> consent forms</a> every few months to ensure everything is up to date and adheres to your specific practice policies. This should include information surrounding vacations and taking time off work.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Much Vacation Time Can You Take?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">This is entirely subjective and depends on how you ultimately structure your therapy practice. There are no universal vacation standards for healthcare professionals.</p><p id=\"\">If you're just starting, you may be more concerned about building a caseload than taking time off. But once your business feels more established, it may be reasonable to take a vacation or extended weekend a few times each year. Most therapists find they work <em id=\"\">better </em>when they have some time away from clients to recharge.</p><p id=\"\">It may be helpful to plan to account for these non-paid vacation days. For example, instead of calculating your annual salary based on 52 weeks per year, you might want to calculate this number based on 48 or 50 weeks per year (don't forget to set some time aside for occasional sick days). Longer absences are also possible, but vacations over two weeks typically require more planning.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Do You Financially Prepare for Vacations in Private Practice?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In private practice, you don't accrue any paid time off, and you're responsible for managing your own business and personal budgeting. This needs to be considered while you prioritize taking time off.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some financial recommendations to ensure you can enjoy your breaks:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Calculate your income loss: </strong>It may be helpful to establish exactly how much income you will lose by taking a vacation. To do this, multiply the number of days by the average number of clients you typically see per day with your standard session fee. This offers a clear overview of the financial impact.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Start a vacation fund: </strong>Consider opening a distinct savings account designated for your vacation fund. Deposit a set amount from your practice earnings each month into this account. This turns 'vacation' from a nice luxury into a routine item within your typical budget.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Travel to a conference: </strong>The IRS demonstrates that some parts of a vacation may be<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc511\" id=\"\"> tax-deductible</a> if you can demonstrate they relate to your business. For example, admission and transportation to a professional conference are business expenses. You have to pay for the remaining parts of your trip, but this can be an incentivizing strategy for accruing those much-needed CEUs. Consult with an accountant for more guidance on business deductions.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consider diversifying your income streams: </strong>Many therapists opt to diversify their revenue through other income sources, including teaching, writing, supervising, coaching, consulting, and more. This isn't to say you <em id=\"\">need </em>to have a side hustle. But you may find that having an extra financial buffer helps when considering time off.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Decide if you want to work for some of your vacation: </strong>Although this may not be the most popular choice, some therapists choose to work part of their vacation. This can be an attractive option if you provide telehealth, as it maintains some continuity of clinical care and also earns you some income while you're away. Double-check your licensing board laws for specific guidance on which clinical duties you can still perform while out of your own state.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Prioritizing Mental Health Wellness at Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we see how hard you and your colleagues work.

Burnout is a multifaceted problem without one single solution, but tedious clinical documentation can drive exhaustion, frustration, and apathy at all stages of one's professional career.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we thoroughly address documentation burden and its subsequent causes and effects. We'll also show you how you can optimize our dynamic electronic health record platform to streamline your routine paperwork.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What Is Documentation Burden?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Documentation is essential for treatment plans, tracking progress, and completing necessary insurance and billing forms. However, the growing volume of paperwork in modern healthcare can feel overwhelming and daunting.</p><p id=\"\">Documentation burden refers to the intense effort expended on healthcare documentation. This burden can coincide with numerous adverse effects, including reduced quality of patient care, clinician burnout, and ineffective documentation. With more agencies and insurance companies upping documentation demands, mental health professionals need to look after themselves.</p><p id=\"\">Documentation burden can also result from:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>navigating the complexity of modern billing and coding practices</li><li>clear shifts from high-quality care to offering services that can be reimbursed by insurance companies</li><li>stringent community mental health or grant requirements</li><li>personal tendencies (procrastination, feeling unprepared to manage documentation, lack of professional support)</li><li>sense of depersonalization or disconnection from paperwork, as it may feel like it's more for the insurance company or agency than the benefit of the client or patient well-being</li></ul><p id=\"\">Documentation burden is a problem for both clinicians and patients alike. If you feel overwhelmed by paperwork, you may have less bandwidth to devote to patient care or treatment planning. Rushed or incomplete documentation can result in dangerous errors, which can result in healthcare miscommunication or potential harm to patient safety.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Addressing Documentation Burnout</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Unfortunately, most companies haven't made any documentation burden reduction efforts. The opposite tends to be true. To comply with clinical and regulatory demands, many agencies focus more on paperwork than they do on provider or patient satisfaction.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we are addressing health worker burnout at the forefront. While, at times, paperwork may be a 'necessary evil,' leveraging your current systems and protocols can help you become more efficient with documentation.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some tips to reduce your clinical documentation burden:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Optimize Your Electronic Health Record System</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If you're still using paper-based forms, it is likely time to consider <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/ehr-replacement-10-signs-its-definitely-time-to-change-your-ehr\" id=\"\">switching to electronic health records</a> (EHR). Online forms help you and your patients complete all necessary forms virtually and efficiently.</p><p id=\"\">Unfortunately, many EHR platforms are clunky and <em id=\"\">not </em>intuitive for clinicians. Inefficient EHR systems can contribute to resentment, frustration, and burnout. That's why, at Navix Health, we are passionate about addressing the clinician documentation burden in every part of our platform. We achieve this by:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>having an extensive library of forms available</li><li>offering the ability to customize forms based on your individual practice</li><li>automating appointment reminders</li><li>streamlining<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/are-you-missing-these-crucial-elements-in-your-therapist-informed-consent-forms\" id=\"\"> consent forms</a> and insurance verification benefits</li><li>providing ongoing support via our expert team</li></ul><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Leverage Technology to Your Benefit</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Optimizing modern technology can dramatically benefit your clinical documentation and health records data. At Navix Health, we offer the following benefits in our platform.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Artificial intelligence:</strong> AI-powered tools can support everything from billing automation and coding to structuring documentation. <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/navix-ai\" id=\"\">Navix AI</a> can help clinicians save up to 80% of time spent on documentation via automated summarization, assessment, and progress updates.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Voice recognition software:</strong> Voice dictation can increase your documentation rate and effectively reduce documentation burden. <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/navixscribe\" id=\"\">NavixScribe</a> is a HIPAA-compliant, AI-powered toll that transcribes clinical sessions and writes optimized, formatted notes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Natural language processing (NLP): </strong>NLP automatically integrates crucial information from human language to assist with keyword extraction, text summarization, and part-of-speech tagging. This can simplify documentation and streamline maintaining clinical records.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consider Engaging in Collaborative Documentation</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Although it has some limitations, collaborative documentation may increase clinician efficiency and reduce time spent documenting treatment. Some patients also prefer this method, as it promotes transparency. This may help them feel more involved in their process.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Establish transparent goals: </strong>Explain the purpose of collaborative documentation to your clients. Ensure they understand how it will augment their treatment. Define their role and let them know how their input will be integrated. This is key for establishing <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/goal-setting-in-therapy-empowering-client-success\" id=\"\">initial therapeutic goals</a>.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Engage in collaborative goal-setting: </strong>Engage the client in determining their clinical goals and periodically review progress toward these goals together. Remain receptive to feedback and document progress accordingly in session notes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Use accessible, user-friendly language: </strong>As much as possible, avoid excessive clinical jargon and ensure your client understands how and what you opt to document.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Remain flexible and adaptive: </strong>You may need to change documentation approaches based on your client’s specific preferences and comfort level. This should be taken into consideration throughout the treatment process.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increase Your Documentation Pacing</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Improving the pace and standard of your documentation may require adjusting some personal habits. Often, we overlook how certain inefficient practices <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life\" id=\"\">waste valuable time</a>. Here are a few strategies to consider:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Adopt a standardized format:</strong> Choose a consistent note-writing format, such as SOAP, DAP, or BIRP, and adhere to it for every note. This uniformity will streamline your documentation process.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Batch documentation tasks:</strong> Instead of sporadically trying to \"find time\" to complete paperwork, many professionals find it more efficient to dedicate specific blocks of time to focus solely on documentation. This approach can help maintain momentum and reduce the feeling of overwhelm.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Seek guidance from colleagues or supervisors:</strong> If you find it challenging to complete your paperwork efficiently, don't hesitate to consult your supervisor or colleagues. They may offer valuable insights or strategies to help you improve your pace and overall efficiency.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Distribute documentation responsibilities:</strong> In a team-based care model, sharing documentation duties among team members can significantly reduce individual burden and prevent burnout. By collaboratively assigning specific documentation tasks to professionals such as nurses, physicians, and therapists, this approach can lighten your load and cultivate better communication and collaboration across the team.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Use a virtual assistant: </strong><a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/28-ways-a-virtual-assistant-can-support-your-mental-health-practice\" id=\"\">Virtual assistants</a> can help with numerous tasks, including booking appointments, calendar management, managing new inquiries, facilitating cancellations and rescheduled appointments, and client onboarding. They may also support insurance billing, including benefits verification, sending <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/therapy-superbill-everything-you-need-to-know\" id=\"\">superbills</a>, and processing copays. All of this can free up your time and give you much-needed peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Augmenting Your Clinical Practice With Navix Health</h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we prioritize clinician satisfaction by streamlining technology and documentation, so you can focus on what truly matters: your clients' well-being.

Being in-network with insurance plans means a steadier source of client referrals and a more predictable income. There also tends to be less need for marketing or other business-related practices.</p><p id=\"\">But there are also significant downsides to taking insurance, and you may want to leave panels due to some or all of these common factors:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tedious administrative tasks: </strong>Navigating insurance can be complex and time-consuming, and some therapists find it frustrating to spend all that time dealing with phone calls, insurance paperwork, and other parts of the billing process.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Low reimbursement rates: </strong>Maintaining a private practice can be costly, but insurance reimbursements may not adequately cover your living expenses. This can create financial hardship for some therapists, especially if the majority of your caseload uses insurance for their care. Furthermore, insurance companies may take weeks or months to process and reimburse claims.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Limited flexibility or autonomy: </strong>Private pay practices inherently allow for more flexibility and creativity in your work. You aren't dictated by what insurance mandates you to do.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Too many clients: </strong>Sometimes therapists accepting insurance have high caseloads to offset the lower reimbursement rates. This may coincide with <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-self-care-tips-for-managing-therapist-burnout\" id=\"\">burnout</a> or the phenomenon of working with clients outside of your desired niche or expertise. In all cases, this can affect the quality of your therapy sessions and the satisfaction generated from your work.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Do You Leave an Insurance Panel?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Once you decide to leave an insurance company, you'll want to first review the contract terms. Each panel will have a 'notice period' required.</p><p id=\"\">You will need to formally inform your insurance panel of your choice to terminate your contract. Carefully review each contract to determine how much notice you must provide.</p><p id=\"\">After the notice period and termination process concludes, you should still follow up with the insurance company to confirm that the request has been fully processed. You may need to address any outstanding balance issues or contract concerns.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Notifying Your Clients About Insurance Changes</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists often hesitate to leave insurance panels because they rightfully feel concerned about the impact their choice has on their clients. This is a valid worry, and you should prepare for it well in advance.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Be mindful of your own reactions and pain points: </strong>Leaving insurance can sometimes be a tedious and uncomfortable process. Anticipate that you may feel guilty, upset, anxious, or protective over your current clients. Some of them may also react intensely- fears of abandonment or rejection may emerge, and it's important to offer a supportive space where clients can freely express their emotions.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Determine your cash rate: </strong>You need to decide your <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-setting-fees-in-private-practice-and-what-to-avoid\" id=\"\">standard fee</a> for cash-paying clients, and you can determine this by assessing your level of experience, current market rate, and expertise. You may want to consider instilling a sliding scale for existing clients who can't afford your full fee.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Provide ample notice: </strong>It's always a best practice to inform clients about your practice changes well in advance. Some may want to end therapy right away, whereas others will want to move through a full termination process.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Provide referrals to other in-network therapists: </strong>It's important to have referrals on hand for clients who will no longer be working with you. If you can't find providers in-network, get contacts for lower-fee services, such as local community health organizations, training facilities, or nonprofits.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Be mindful of clients in the interim stage: </strong>As you transition from insurance, you will likely still receive new client inquiries from people who want to use their insurance to pay for therapy. Review your contract carefully to determine when clients must opt out of using insurance to see them in your practice.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Help clients tap into out-of-network benefits: </strong>Even if you’re not an in-network provider, you still may be able to provide <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/therapy-superbill-everything-you-need-to-know\" id=\"\">therapy superbills</a> for your clients. While reimbursement is not guaranteed (insurance can always deny a claim), they can save your clients money.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Smoothly Transition to Private Pay Clients</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most therapists find that attracting more private pay clients inherently requires a different <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make\" id=\"\">marketing strategy</a>. Your therapy practice needs to stand out solely on its own, and you need to have a solid plan to attract clients who can pay you at your desired rate.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Build a cash buffer for yourself: </strong>Ultimately, there's not really a foolproof method for knowing how many clients will stay with you after leaving insurance. For some time, you may make less money, and you should be aware of this risk.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Honing in on your niche: </strong>While private pay therapists can be generalists, specialized expertise can help you differentiate yourself from other therapists. Similarly, when you know exactly which clients you want to work with, your marketing strategy feels more concise and effective. You can start reflecting on your niche by spending some time assessing your ideal client. What are their presenting issues? What do they hope</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Building your practice presence: </strong>Therapists accepting insurance don't need to worry all that much about having a robust presence. But people who pay out of pocket need to have a way to <em id=\"\">find </em>you, so you need to know where and how to find new clients via your marketing.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Networking with other providers: </strong>Strengthening your professional network is essential when you have a fee-for-service practice. Networking helps build your professional reputation, and it can secure you more referrals in both the short-term and long-term.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Investing in good marketing: </strong>Marketing comes in many forms, from social media exposure to SEO to targeted ads to paper mailers. Each strategy has its own pros and cons, but you should definitely have a strategy in place.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">All therapists know the importance of obtaining informed consent before commencing clinical treatment. During this process, you must provide relevant information about your practice, approach, rights and responsibilities, potential benefits and risks, <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-setting-fees-in-private-practice-and-what-to-avoid\">fees, and billing practices</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With that, informed consent also represents an <em id=\"\">ongoing process. </em>You may need to review your policies periodically- especially if you change core features of your practice or work with clients who may not inherently understand the general structure of therapy.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">But when was the last time you actually reviewed your informed consent document? If it's been some time, now may be the time to reevaluate your consent forms to ensure you have the following details covered.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we’ll pinpoint some crucial information you may want to consider adding to your practice documentation.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Parameters of the Therapeutic Relationship</h2><p id=\"\">The <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/subtle-mistakes-therapists-make-when-building-therapeutic-alliances\">therapeutic alliance</a> is unlike any other relationship, and you want to clearly articulate these professional limits. Your informed consent form should include details about how you will handle communication in between sessions.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">For example, you might say, <em id=\"\">I only permit the use of email for session cancellations or rescheduling. If you need immediate support, please contact ___. </em>If you have other policies about between-session communication, include them here.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Your informed consent agreement needs to state your guidelines about technology use within and outside of therapy. This includes your policy on email communication, text messaging, telehealth platforms, and the current security measures related to electronic communication.</p><p id=\"\">In other words, clients shouldn't have to guess whether to text or email you if they need to reach out. Your informed consent process should clearly state the measures of communication, and you should reinstate these boundaries as needed throughout treatment.</p><p id=\"\">This is where you should also indicate that you will not approach your clients if you you run into them outside of the office. Finally, make sure you indicate how you <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\">manage client crises</a>. This means:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>Identifying what constitutes a crisis or emergency</li><li>Outlining how clients can reach you during a crisis (if you permit this option)</li><li>Providing alternative resources for clients during crises&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Payment Information</h2><p id=\"\">Indicate when payment is due for each session. If you <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs#:~:text=Accepting%20Insurance%20in%20Private%20Practice%3A%20Definitive%20Pros%20and%20Cons\" id=\"\">accept insurance</a>, you might charge copays/coinsurance on the morning of medical treatment. Or, you may charge right after or at the end of the clinical day. In addition, you may set up a payment plan where clients can pay you directly before or after the session. However, this needs to be indicated.</p><p id=\"\">Your informed consent also must outline what will happen if balances are carried. Consider adding a clause that says, <em id=\"\">“No balances will be carried. If a balance should occur, further sessions will be placed on hold until the balance is paid and a $10 late fee applied. Billing services are not available.”</em></p><h2 id=\"\">Termination Process Information</h2><p id=\"\">The treatment process is not indefinite, and your informed consent should discuss how, when, and why you might discontinue treatment. Of course, these limits can, at times, be subjective and adhere to a case-by-case basis, but it's important to provide some general information on this topic.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Clients should be adequately informed about how termination might occur when seeking informed consent. This information should include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>your standard procedures for terminating therapy</li><li>details about how clients can voluntarily request to end treatment</li><li>your policy for providing referrals to other qualified providers</li></ul><p id=\"\">Some clinicians also stick to a specific cancellation policy when it comes to termination. For example, you might write, <em id=\"\">If you cancel 4 sessions within 6 months, please note I may not be able to guarantee your standard clinical appointment. This is not necessarily indicative of termination, but it will mean that we will have to discuss revising our therapy schedule.&nbsp;</em></p><h2 id=\"\">Minors and Parental Consent in Psychotherapy</h2><p id=\"\">Obtaining informed consent for minors entails parental involvement. With that, you need to state how your clinical practice honors the minor's confidentiality and also shares relevant treatment information with caregivers. Always refer to your local laws to determine any legal considerations concerning youth.</p><p id=\"\">Consider adding a co-parenting agreement if you insist that separated or divorced parents agree and consent to therapeutic services.</p><p id=\"\">If you work with families or couples and adhere to a 'no secrets' policy, your written informed consent document should outline this. Specify the parameters for this policy and when they might be enacted.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Legal Responsibilities</h2><p id=\"\">You may want to consider adding in your informed consent documents that you don't voluntarily get involved in legal matters. However, in some cases, legal involvement may be inevitable. If that's the case, you should indicate how much you charge (your hourly rate or more) for performing this kind of work.</p><p id=\"\">Many providers provide informed consent that specifically states, <em id=\"\">'It is agreed that should there be legal proceedings (such as, but not limited to custody disputes and divorce, injuries, lawsuits, etc.), I understand that neither I nor my attorney, nor anyone else acting on my behalf, will call on (therapist name) to testify in court, nor will disclosure of clinical records be requested.</em></p><h2 id=\"\">No-Show and Late Policies</h2><p id=\"\">It is important to list your cancellation policies, particularly if you charge a session fee for late cancellations. 24 hours is the standard practice, though some providers have 48 or 72-hour rules. If you have any exceptions (i.e. sickness or emergencies, the ability to reschedule), list them. Indicate how much you will charge and when this charge will occur.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You should also consider specifying what \"late\" means when it comes to arriving at a session. Is it 10 minutes? 15 minutes? Longer? If they do not show up before that window, will you charge them? If they are only present for half the session, how will you charge?</p><h2 id=\"\">Social Media Information</h2><p id=\"\">With more healthcare providers using social media to advertise their practices, it's crucial to have information about this within your informed consent procedure.</p><p id=\"\">Consider including:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>Boundaries about social media interactions</li><li>Risks associated with following or engaging with you on social media platforms</li><li>How you (or your practice) use social media professionally</li><li>Boundaries about accepting friend or follow requests on personal accounts</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Professional Trust and Executor Information</h2><p id=\"\">Healthcare providers should also consider listing information about their professional trust administrator. If you have a professional will (and you should!), indicate who your executor is, how and when the trust may be enacted, and what clients can generally expect should you no longer be able to meet with them.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Streamlining Your Onboarding Process With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we understand all the logistics associated with running your clinical practice.

From taking care of your administrative tasks to managing insurance claims to boosting your social media, the right assistant can give you free time to focus on your top priority- the well-being of your clients.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we'll overview the main benefits that virtual assistants can bring to therapy practices, and we'll also discuss how to vet the right people to add to your team. At Navix Health, we're deeply committed to supporting mental health professionals to augment their practices- virtual assistants are just one dynamic option for optimizing your business.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Appointment Scheduling and Management</strong></h2><p id=\"\">How often are you scheduling and then rescheduling client appointments? Have you ever unintentionally double-booked your mental health patients? If you run a large medical practice, you oversee a master schedule- along with each clinician's schedule, and all of that administrative work can become a fast time-suck.</p><p id=\"\">Virtual assistant services can help:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>manage the complete process of booking appointments through your online system, phone, or email</li><li>oversee calendar management and sync it appropriately with your EMR</li><li>ensure that appointment reminders are sent and received</li><li>manage new inquiries from potential clients</li><li>facilitate cancellations and rescheduling appointments</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Client Onboarding</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Getting a new client situated with your therapy practice requires multiple steps, from the initial consultation to intake paperwork to securing payment for the first session. If you're a mental health professional handling this yourself, you're likely spending hours each week with onboarding. And if you facilitate a <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/14-essential-questions-therapists-need-to-consider-before-opening-a-group-practice\" id=\"\">larger group practice</a>, getting more patients often takes up even more time.</p><p id=\"\">Mental health virtual assistants can help streamline initial communication and onboarding for new clients. This can come in many forms, but it may include specific administrative support focused on:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>responding to relevant referral inquiries on your behalf</li><li>screening new clients to determine eligibility</li><li>managing your waitlist</li><li>sending intake forms and ensuring they are completed</li><li>monitoring voicemail, email, and directory inquiries</li><li>scheduling initial consultations or first sessions</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Insurance Billing</strong></h2><p id=\"\">There is no doubt that managing insurance can be arduous and time-consuming for busy mental health professionals. If your practice<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/accepting-insurance-in-private-practice-definitive-pros-and-cons\" id=\"\"> accepts insurance</a>, you must ensure that your clients are in-network (or appropriately using their out-of-network benefits). You must also stay on top of all claims forms and documentation requirements.</p><p id=\"\">If you're interested in getting paneled onto insurance, a virtual assistant may also be able to facilitate this process for you. They can streamline your paperwork process and act as a partner as you engage with your insurance coordinators.</p><p id=\"\">In addition, when managing billing, a virtual assistant can help:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>verify benefits and ensure ongoing insurance verification</li><li>generate and <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/therapy-superbill-everything-you-need-to-know\" id=\"\">send superbills</a> for out-of-network clients</li><li>send invoices, process payments, and update credit card information</li><li>research and resolve claim rejections or denials</li><li>process weekly co-pays</li><li>support with claim submissions</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Social Media Marketing and Content Creation</strong></h2><p id=\"\">While therapists don't necessarily <em id=\"\">need </em>to use social media for their practice, having a robust online presence can help you broaden your reach and obtain more clients. However, managing social media can be <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-really-maximize-your-time-15-productivity-tips-for-therapists\" id=\"\">time-consuming</a>, and you risk negatively impacting your reputation if you arbitrarily create content without having an effective strategy.</p><p id=\"\">When it comes to overseeing social media, virtual assistants can help:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>create engaging content, including graphics, posts, reels, and videos tailored to your ideal clients</li><li>help with scheduling content based on your client's schedule</li><li>engage with your audience by responding to messages, comments, and mentions</li><li>participate in relevant forums, groups, or communities central to your practice</li><li>manage social media advertising campaigns and optimize your current ad performance</li><li>track key metrics, including your engagement, reach, and conversion rates</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Personal Support and Management</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In addition to your practice management, virtual assistants can also help you better manage your day-to-day life tasks and other professional needs. For example, they may be able to:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>create to-do lists for you based on your most important tasks each day</li><li>research optimal professional development or continuing education units for you to take</li><li>help with travel planning, including booking flights, accommodations, and transportation</li><li>schedule personal appointments (hair, nails, massage, personal therapy, etc.)</li><li>organize family and leisure activities to reduce stress and make your overall life easier</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">When Should You Consider Hiring a Virtual Assistant?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">One of the hardest parts of running a thriving therapy practice is the <em id=\"\">wearing-all-the-hats </em>phenomenon. In other words, you're not only responsible for providing excellent clinical care, but you also must ensure you manage all the administrative tasks associated with being a private practice owner.</p><p id=\"\">While there's no perfect time to consider virtual assistance services, you may want to consider this option if any of the following apply:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>you have no real concept of a work-life balance because you're so busy</li><li>you're starting to experience burnout due to all the tasks you have to do</li><li>you're leaving money on the table because you get so caught up in administrative work</li><li>you're looking to expand your practice within the next year or so</li><li>you keep sensing that you're \"doing more\" without getting the results you want to see</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Questions to Ask a Potential Mental Health Virtual Assistant</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Virtual assistants have different specialties and levels of experience. Before hiring an assistant, it may be helpful to spend some time drawing out your job description. What are you most looking to outsource right now? What expertise are you seeking? What unique needs does your practice currently have?</p><p id=\"\">Some helpful vetting questions can include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li>What experience do you have working with mental health practices?</li><li>What are the main services you offer?</li><li>Who will be my point of contact? Do you work alone or as part of a team?</li><li>How will we be communicating and what is your preferred method for communication?</li><li>Can you provide me with any referrals of work you've done within the mental health field?</li><li>How do you charge for your services? On an hourly rate? Flat-rate basis? Monthly retention?</li></ul><p id=\"\">It's not uncommon for virtual assistants to initiate a trial when working with new clients. This is a good thing- it helps you both establish a routine with one another, and you get a feel for how they work and understand the specific needs of your business. Remember that communication is <em id=\"\">key </em>to getting and staying on the same page.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Streamlining Your Therapy Practice With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we're all about helping our practitioners save time and focus on cinching in their most important clinical priorities.

With that said, documentation can feel overwhelming, and you certainly don't want to risk missing something crucial.</p><p id=\"\">There are many different kinds of therapy forms, but the important takeaway is discerning what you must have for each client. In this article, we will review the main forms most therapists need in their practices. We'll also address some common questions newer therapists experience when onboarding new clients.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Crucial Forms For Your Therapy Practice</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Whether you see clients in person or online, you must ensure that your practice maintains excellent documentation and adheres to all laws and ethics regarding client care. This is important for keeping your profession in good standing, but it’s also essential when navigating contentious issues like client confidentiality, <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/best-practices-for-navigating-insurance-audits-in-private-practice\" id=\"\">insurance audits</a>, and more.</p><p id=\"\">Make sure your paperwork contains the following forms:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Informed consent: </strong>Your informed consent outlines the rules and expectations of your therapy process. It also outlines the nuances of confidentiality, the risks and benefits of therapy, and the client's rights in treatment. Clients deserve to make autonomous decisions about their healthcare treatment, and informed consent honors this need.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Office policies: </strong>Your office policy form should list the general housekeeping within your therapy services. These details include relevant information about your scheduling, fees, cancellation policy, and any other details about how you practice.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Assessment forms: </strong>Depending on what you treat in your practice, you may send assessment forms to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns. These forms can be used in both individual and couples counseling, and they may be repeatedly completed throughout an episode of care to best track progress.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Good faith estimate: </strong>Mental health professionals in private practice need to administer good faith estimates to break down how much a client will pay out-of-pocket to work with you. It needs to contain the type of services rendered, your rate, and how much they can anticipate spending after a specific amount of sessions.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Credit card authorization form: </strong>This form contains your client's stored credit card information, so you can easily charge for sessions. It should include confirmation that they consent to being charged for therapy as well as their name, date, and signature.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consent for telehealth consultation: </strong>This form must be signed before commencing any telehealth sessions. This form should include the client's name, date, and signature confirming they understand how to use your telehealth software.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Intake questionnaire: </strong>The intake questionnaire contains information about your client's medical history, mental health issues, and other important details relevant to your therapeutic process and treatment plan. These questionnaires typically ask questions about your client's relationships, family, career, medications, current substance use, suicide attempts or suicidal ideation, and previous experiences in therapy.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Closing summaries: </strong>Sometimes known as termination documents or termination summaries, these forms are completed after concluding a treatment episode. They should include your client's name, the date you began treatment, the date you ended termination, why treatment ended, and notes about the client's progress and overall prognosis.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Treatment plan: </strong>Your treatment plan focuses on the goals and interventions used within your therapy process. You will list what you intend to focus your sessions on, and this acts as a blueprint for guiding your therapy work.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Progress notes: </strong>Progress notes (also known as <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-write-clinical-notes-faster\" id=\"\">clinical notes</a>) are legally and ethically required by all mental health licensing boards. It is often considered best practice to write notes as if a client <em id=\"\">could </em>read them (as a client can always request access) or as if you could be subpoenaed by court. Keep in mind that you should separate any psychotherapy notes (notes for yourself) from these progress notes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Authorization to release information: </strong>Also known as an ROI, this is required for exchanging information about your client with other individuals or providers. You need clients to sign this form if you plan to coordinate care with their family members, health insurance companies, primary care physicians, or anyone else on their treatment team.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Insurance verification form: </strong>If you <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/accepting-insurance-in-private-practice-definitive-pros-and-cons\" id=\"\">accept insurance in your practice</a>, this form is essential. The insurance verification form collects information about your client's health insurance, the nature of this protected health information, and all deductible and copay details.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">When Should You Send Your Paperwork to Clients?</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It's a good idea to send your paperwork before the first session when coordinating care with a new client. You want time to review these forms in advance to ensure the issues are within your scope of competence. You also want your client to understand the logistics of psychotherapy, including how payment works, how to access sessions, and what to expect when meeting with you.</p><p id=\"\">That said, it's still important to verbally review paperwork at the onset of treatment. Make sure your clients understand the logistics of informed consent and verbally agree to meet your terms and conditions.</p><p id=\"\">If you're managing a crisis, you may need to coordinate care, phone calls, and other treatment services before paperwork is completed. In most cases, this is acceptable, but you still want to ensure your clients are appropriately consenting to their care.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Where Can Mental Health Professionals Find Private Practice Paperwork?</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Some people start with free templates when they first start their practice. While this can save you time and money <em id=\"\">upfront, </em>it may be a costly mistake if you run into problems later on.</p><p id=\"\">It may be a good idea to invest in a lawyer to review your documentation and ensure that everything is compliant. At the end of the day, it's your responsibility to adhere to state laws and keep your paperwork up-to-date.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Of all the contentious discussions mental health providers have, the pros and cons of therapists accepting insurance ranks at one of the top. Whether you're starting your practice or several years in, there's a good chance you've faced this inner conflict at some point in your career. I</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we’re dedicated to transparency within behavioral health, and we’re equally dedicated to supporting clinicians in the hard and meaningful work they provide. In this article, we'll unpack the good, bad, and truth of accepting insurance.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Pros of Accepting Insurance</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists who accept insurance are directly reimbursed for the services they provide. Clients who pay for therapy are responsible for their co-pay as well as any agreed-upon costs dictated when using insurance. By accepting insurance, you agree to be paid at a flat-rate reimbursement rate, and your treatment plans must comply with the insurance company's requirements.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">More Clients</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the main advantages of contracting with insurance companies is that you're accessing a larger referral network. This typically leads to more clients with less overhead marketing costs. If you're just building your practice, this option can be invaluable.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Steadier Income</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Having more clients can result in a more consistent and steady income. You can also easily calculate your income each month based on how many clients you see and the reimbursement rate you receive from each insurance panel. This benefit can be particularly advantageous for newer therapists or those who are the breadwinners of their families.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Less Marketing Efforts</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Therapists paneled with health insurance companies may need to spend less time <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make\" id=\"\">marketing their practices</a> or networking with other healthcare professionals. This may free up your time to focus more on your clinical efforts, and it may allow you to also have a greater work-life balance.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Greater Accessibility to Care</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Insurance companies provide coverage for mental health care that lower-income people may not be able to otherwise afford. Many therapists value accessibility when it comes to their therapy services, so being in-network can give you a significant advantage in being able to best serve your community.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cons of Accepting Insurance</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Accepting insurance has its downsides, and all therapists should be aware of the potential drawbacks to working with insurance plans in their practice.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Credentialing Process Can Be Slow</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Credentialing can be long and tedious, with many providers having to wait several months before getting onto panels. You might also get rejected or placed on hold. That said, some therapists choose to outsource this task to third-party providers who support the credentialing process.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Lack of Transparent Reimbursement Rates</strong></h3><p id=\"\">There's no current way to determine specific reimbursement rates before applying to be on a panel. Rates are confidential due to antitrust laws and cannot be shared across providers. Instead, before signing up for a company, you'll be given a fee schedule with CPT codes listed. This fee refers to the agreed-upon amount the insurance pays providers for the services rendered.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Low Reimbursement Rates</strong></h3><p id=\"\">One of the main issues associated with taking insurance is that your take-home rate can be low. And unlike private pay, insurance companies dictate the rates they pay. You may be able to negotiate a higher rate, but this is more of an exception than a rule.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Required to Provide a Mental Health Diagnosis</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Most insurance companies dictate that therapists provide a mental health diagnosis to necessitate their treatment. While this is not a problem for all providers, some therapists do not feel comfortable diagnosing their clients and/or do not want to provide sensitive information to a third party. Likewise, some clients feel uncomfortable with this kind of disclosure being on their medical records.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Risk of Audits and Clawbacks</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Every health insurance company has a right to <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/best-practices-for-navigating-insurance-audits-in-private-practice\" id=\"\">audit its providers</a>. Depending on the plan, they can go back several years to audit your mental health records. A clawback refers to a retrospective audit where they ask providers to pay back money if they determine that a service was not sufficiently covered or documented.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Pros of Not Accepting Insurance</strong></h2><p id=\"\">There are significant advantages to choosing to opt out of being on an insurance panel. Your therapy sessions are entirely in your jurisdiction, and you don't have to spend excessive time filing claims or trying to seek reimbursement for overdue payments.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Complete Control Over Your Caseload</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If your mental health services are fully private, you are in total control of your clientele. With that, you may be more likely to refine your practice to accurately reflect your niche. This can <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-really-maximize-your-time-15-productivity-tips-for-therapists\" id=\"\">free up time</a> to pursue trainings that is most aligned with your values and ideal clients.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Determine Your Session Fee</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If you take insurance, each therapy session rate is predetermined. But if you're working with people who pay out-of-pocket, you establish the rate. This can be especially helpful for ensuring that you feel adequately paid your worth.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">No Constraints to Treatment</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Unfortunately, an insurance company can deny care for any reason. Many therapists resonate with the frustration of trying to provide services only to be told the client does not meet the medical necessity for treatment. This puts both providers and clients in a precarious situation, particularly if clients are in a dire financial situation and/or are struggling to find therapists who can continue to provide them with a continuity of care.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cons of Not Accepting Insurance</strong></h2><p id=\"\">One of the main downsides of <em id=\"\">not </em>taking insurance is that you're fully responsible for looking after your business. You may have to invest more in upfront marketing and networking costs. You may also have a slower stream of referrals.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">More Marketing and Networking Efforts</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In-network providers can often lean on the insurance panels to supply clients to them. But if you have your own practice and don't take insurance, you're responsible for getting the word out there. This can be daunting for some therapists, especially if they don't have much interest in managing the business side of their work.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Inconsistent or Unsteady Income</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Private practice income can be inconsistent, and the local economy can certainly affect how and when potential clients seek out services. When times are financially challenging, people often pull back on discretionary spending, and that can include medical services like therapy.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Many Clients Want to Use Their Insurance Company</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The average person spends<a href=\"https://www.moneygeek.com/insurance/health/average-cost-of-health-insurance/\" id=\"\"> just over $500</a> for an individual silver insurance coverage plan each month. With such exorbitant healthcare costs, it's only typical for people to first seek to subsidize therapy costs by looking for in-network therapists. Depending on where you live or what you specialize in, the majority of potential clients may not be able to afford therapy without using their insurance plan.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Alternatives to Being on Insurance Panels</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists have numerous options when it comes to structuring pay for their sessions. If you don't want to accept insurance, here are some other choices to consider:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Offering superbills: </strong><a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/therapy-superbill-everything-you-need-to-know\" id=\"\">Superbills</a> allow clients to tap into their insurance company's out-of-network benefits. You offer the itemized services provided, and they submit claims to their insurance directly for reimbursement. You're not involved unless the insurance requires any additional information from you.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Providing a sliding scale fee: </strong>Many private pay therapists offer a sliding scale for clients who cannot afford their cash rate. It's important to determine this fee in advance and have a system for who will be eligible to receive it. You should also consider how and when you might raise this fee for potential clients.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Having some cash-pay clients: </strong>It's possible to offer a mix-and-match practice, where you work with some clients paneled through insurance and others via private pay. You need to determine each insurance company's protocol on this policy.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using Navix Health to Augment Your Private Practice</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we are here to help clinicians navigate the logistics of onboarding new clients, track insurance billing, send claim forms, and help you streamline some of your more demanding and time-consuming tasks.</p><p id=\"\">We support both seasoned and new providers with our comprehensive system.

We're in a new age of dynamic cloud solutions, artificial intelligence, and fully customized programming. But with so many EHR systems on the market, how do you choose the right one? And when is an optimal time to make this potentially daunting switch?</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we will break down the signs it's time to upgrade your EHR software. Let's get into what you need to know.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">10 Signs You Need to Consider a New EHR Solution</strong></h2><p id=\"\">We get it. The transition process from one EHR system to a new system can feel downright overwhelming. Most healthcare facilities avoid making the switch, but sticking with an inefficient provider can result in everything from compromised patient data to frustrated clinicians to poorer communication within your healthcare organization.</p><p id=\"\">Here are the leading signs it's time to consider making your EHR transition:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your EHR System is Rigid</strong></h3><p id=\"\">All EHR workflow should be dynamic and fluid to you or your company's specific needs. Unfortunately, some of the older electronic health records software remains archaic and cookie-cutter. With these systems, you need to adapt to their protocol rather than vice versa. While this may work for some providers, it may be missing the flexible features you need to streamline your practice.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your Practice Has Outgrown Its EHR Provider</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Many medical practices have humble beginnings, but if you've grown over the past few years, your current EHR may not have grown with you. Whether you're expanding to newer locations, hiring more clinicians to<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/14-essential-questions-therapists-need-to-consider-before-opening-a-group-practice\" id=\"\"> open a group practice</a>, or adding specialized services, it's essential that you don't feel limited by your software. Not every solution is designed to grow with its providers, so if you feel like you're doing more work on your EHR than you'd prefer, it may be time to switch.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">You're Not Getting Productive or Consistent Customer Service</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Not all EHR systems prioritize customer service, but many medical providers find hands-on support necessary for achieving optimal patient outcomes. When the company's customer service is solid, you can trust that you won't have to waste hours (or spend additional money) trying to understand a feature. Without this kind of working relationship, there's a good chance you'll be left to figure everything out on your own, and this could be a serious mistake for your company.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Costs of the EHR Software Keep Going Up</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It may be true that you get what you pay for, but many EHR solutions focus on locking people in with a cheap rate only to conceal additional fees within the monthly or annual package. Other companies are known for luring companies in with tempting promotions, but they consistently hike the price once they have their loyal customers. Either way, when you're using an EHR, you need to trust that the price you're paying is fair and free from hidden costs.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">There's No AI Integration</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Despite all the controversy surrounding artificial intelligence, successful healthcare providers view AI as a meaningful tool to augment their practice. For example, rather than agonize over time-consuming tasks (like writing a treatment plan),<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/navix-ai\" id=\"\"> AI can link the necessary information</a> throughout the software system making it easy to<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-to-write-clinical-notes-faster\" id=\"\"> save time on documentation</a>.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The EHR Design or Programming is Clunky</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Unless you (and everyone in your company) are highly savvy with technology, some of the more complex EHR systems end up being more of a hassle than a convenience. Ideally, your EHR should feel like one seamless system where all features are intuitive and easy to customize.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Integration With Other Software Is Minimal or Missing</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Unfortunately, many EHR systems lack compatibility and communication access with other systems. This requires providers to spend more time manually inputting data or copying and pasting certain parts of their health systems. The right EHR is seamlessly compatible with major tools including Zoom, DocuSign, and Google. This integration allows you to create customized reports and provide fully-encrypted telehealth services.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your Current System Doesn't Have a Mobile App</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In this day and age, mobility isn't a luxury- it's a necessity for every on-the-go medical professional. Providers need EHR systems that have intuitive apps that can be accessed whenever they need to. If your existing EHR doesn't have a<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-role-of-mobile-apps-in-behavioral-health-management\" id=\"\"> mobile app</a>, this absence can disrupt both the clinician and patient experience. This is particularly true in the event of a healthcare emergency or<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\"> patient crisis</a>.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">You're Concerned About Patient Data and Privacy</strong></h3><p id=\"\">You should <em id=\"\">never </em>have to worry about the integrity of patient safety when using any health information technology. That said, if you're using an older EHR system, you may not be able to ensure the company is staying up to date with all applicable regulations. If that's the case, you need a company that unquestionably prioritizes quality patient care. This means encrypting their data, creating strict access controls for authorized vs. non-authorized users, and conducting routine security audits.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your EHR System Has No Real Knowledge of the Healthcare Industry</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Some EHR systems are simply profit-driven without any real concern for the integrity of a modern healthcare practice. While this may not always seem important when you first use a service, it can become more crucial if your current system fails to keep up with changing trends, regulations, or industry standards. With that, it can be highly advantageous to work with a company backed by healthcare professionals who have worked directly within healthcare roles.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Making Your EHR Switch With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we offer a comprehensive electronic health record tailored to your clinical or medical practice.

Superbills can subsidize the costs of treatment without you having to panel directly with insurance companies.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we'll break down:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">whether you should consider superbills for your therapy practice</li><li id=\"\">what superbills are and what each one needs to contain</li><li id=\"\">top benefits of using superbills in your practice</li><li id=\"\">options for creating superbills</li><li id=\"\">common obstacles clients and providers face with superbills</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What is a Superbill for Therapy?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">A superbill is a formal receipt that allows clients to get reimbursement from their health insurance company for therapy sessions. Superbills are generated by therapists and given directly to clients.</p><p id=\"\">Therapists aren't the only providers who use superbills. Any healthcare provider who works out-of-network may use superbills as part of their practice. This helps keep services affordable for consumers, but the provider doesn't have to work directly with insurance companies.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Which Therapists Can Provide Superbills?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists can offer superbills if the following circumstances apply:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">they do not accept insurance at all</li><li id=\"\">they do accept insurance but they are not paneled with a client's particular insurance company</li><li id=\"\">they are currently awaiting approval to be credentialed with an insurance company</li></ul><p id=\"\">In most cases, superbills are not appropriate when the client is using their in-network benefits. Interns or associates also may not be eligible to provide superbills.</p><p id=\"\">If you are in-network with some insurance companies, you need to review each of their provider policies outlined in your contract. For example, some companies prohibit therapists from charging cash-pay rates to their clients under any circumstances.</p><p id=\"\">Keep in mind that Medicare and Medicaid services may not be eligible for out-of-network benefits. Clients seeking mental health services outside of their insurance company may not receive any monetary insurance benefits.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What Does a Superbill Need to Include?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Each superbill invoice must contain specific information to help clients receive reimbursement. Insurance companies require the following:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Provider Information</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Your name and credentials (i.e. LCSW, LPC, LMFT)</li><li id=\"\">Your contact information and business address</li><li id=\"\">Your license number</li><li id=\"\">Your tax ID or employer identification number (EIN)</li><li id=\"\">Your national provider identifier (NPI)</li></ul><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Client Information</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Full name</li><li id=\"\">Date of birth</li><li id=\"\">Current mailing address</li><li id=\"\">Diagnosis code</li></ul><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Therapy Session Information</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Dates when therapy sessions occurred (also known as dates services rendered)</li><li id=\"\">Location of therapy session (i.e. via telehealth or in an office)</li><li id=\"\">Relevant CPT codes determined by the American Medical Association (AMA)</li><li id=\"\">The fee charged for each session</li><li id=\"\">Total charges</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">‍Benefits of Superbills for Clients</strong></h2><p id=\"\">If you provide out-of-network services, your treatment may be financially inaccessible to potential clients. While this is not inherently problematic, superbills offer a solution to this problem. You retain your full-fee cash rate while clients only have to pay for a portion of the treatment costs.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reduce out-of-pocket expenses: </strong>Superbills lower the cost of therapy for clients. Let's say you charge $150 per session. However, a prospective client has a co-insurance of 40%. Once this client meets their deductible, they are only responsible for paying 40% of her therapy session fee. This means that after receiving eligible reimbursement, she is only responsible for paying $60.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Access to more specialized therapists: </strong>Many therapists don't accept insurance. If a client only wants to use their insurance company to pay for treatment, they may be limited in finding the right provider for their needs. This is especially true if they need a particular specialist. Fortunately, most out-of-network providers offer superbills (because it does not impact their compensation), so this opens accessibility to finding more providers.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">More autonomy and price transparency: </strong>Everyone knows that working with an insurance provider can feel like a financial and logistical nightmare. You never know exactly how much that bill is going to cost! Superbills, on the other hand, provide a concise breakdown of all services rendered. This upfront honesty can promote more autonomy and reinforce the informed consent needed in treatment.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tips for Generating Superbills</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Superbills only take a few minutes to make, and the process is even more simplified if you use an EHR with an embedded superbilling feature.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Manual superbills: </strong>Some therapists make their own superbill template by entering each session's information into a document. It's standard to send this information once a month and then update the dates with each new superbill. You can send the superbill via a HIPAA-secure communication platform.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Automatic superbills: </strong>Most EHRs have the option to automatically generate superbills. All you need to include is your demographic details and relevant practice information along with the session dates and services rendered.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Outsource to a third party: </strong>Some third-party platforms offer support with superbills. They can generate these forms and submit the claim form on behalf of your client. These platforms streamline the process for both clinicians and clients, but they do collect a small fee from the client's reimbursement rate.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Support Clients Submit a Superbill</strong></h2><p id=\"\">A client submits a superbill directly to their insurance company unless they opt to use a third-party outsourcing system.</p><p id=\"\">In most cases, the client simply logs into their insurance company website, clicks 'submit a claim,' and then uploads their superbill and provides any other requested information. Reimbursement can take up to a few weeks.

        "blog-content": "Laughing together in therapy may seem counterintuitive. But therapy laughter can have cathartic benefits, including building rapport, strengthening connection, and reframing certain life circumstances.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Therapy is generally serious and for a good reason. People come to treatment because they want relief. They need professional support for their mental health, and they deserve to work with someone who can competently treat their symptoms.</p><p id=\"\">With that in mind, the idea of laughing together in therapy may seem counterintuitive. But therapy laughter can have cathartic benefits, including building rapport, strengthening connection, and reframing certain life circumstances.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Understanding the Therapeutic Benefits of Laughter</strong></h2><p id=\"\">People are naturally driven to seek humor and laughter. There's nothing quite like sharing a moment of genuine laughter with someone you care about. Not only does it emotionally feel good, but your body benefits from it as well.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Releases endorphins: </strong>Research shows that the body releases endorphins (which are sometimes dubbed as 'natural painkillers') during spontaneous laughter. Endorphins help promote blood flow and can increase your overall well-being.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Puts anger into perspective: </strong>Anger is a necessary emotion, but laughter is <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/creative-interventions-art-music-and-drama-in-therapy\" id=\"\">creatively associated</a> with relieving stress, which can help reduce some emotional sharpness.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Strengthens the immune system: </strong>Research shows that laughter reduces stress hormones and strengthens immune cells, which can bolster your overall physical resilience.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Builds closeness with others: </strong>Social laughter is an expression of positive emotions, and sharing that experience together can promote a sense of emotional intimacy.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">The Role of Mirroring and Connecting</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The relationship sets the foundation where the change in therapy occurs. Regardless of why a client seeks treatment, they need to feel safe, and they should ideally trust their therapist.</p><p id=\"\">Mirroring refers to reflecting a client's behaviors, emotions, and words back to them. When done well, mirroring reflects a high level of attunement. It demonstrates a therapist's ability to actively listen and relate to a client's specific needs. Mirroring is both verbal and nonverbal, and research shows that highly-effective clinicians engage in this skill during the majority of their sessions.</p><p id=\"\">Mirroring is invaluable when it comes to building and maintaining rapport. From this approach, laughter can be a form of mirroring, particularly when moments of lightness occur. Sharing a good laugh- when the moment calls for it- can act as a form of connective support.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Laughter Interventions in Psychotherapy</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Most of the time, laughter in therapy isn't achieved via specific laughter exercises or laughter-inducing exercises. It's more spontaneous and reactive to what's happening in the session. Family therapist, Carl Whitaker, emphasized the benefits of \"embracing\" playfulness and craziness within psychotherapy. Laughter can break up emotion and heighten introspection.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Prescribing the symptom: </strong>This intervention entails a therapist asking the client to worsen the symptom, rather than improve it. For example, if a client wants to set better boundaries with their partner, the therapist would encourage them to act even more passively during their conversations. This, in turn, often empowers the client to focus on their <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/goal-setting-in-therapy-empowering-client-success\" id=\"\">achievable goals</a> toward change.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Worry time: </strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapists sometimes recommend worry time as a homework assignment. Worry time encourages clients to set specific times to focus on their worries. And while this recommendation may sound good in theory, the idea of structuring designated worry times often seems so silly that it makes a client laugh, which offers a point for self-reflection.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Externalizing: </strong>Narrative therapists may instruct clients to externalize themselves from their own problems. Externalization refers to distinguishing problems as separate entities. For example, instead of identifying as \"being anxious,\" a client will identify their anxiety as having its own identity, voice, and needs. This makes the anxiety feel less intense, which can be empowering (and, at times, humorous) for clients.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Funny stories: </strong>Inviting the client to bring their sense of humor into therapy can be important in building rapport. Clients who show high levels of resistance or uncertainty may benefit from this strategy. Sharing stories is also effective for building safety and connection within <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-tips-for-running-better-group-therapy-sessions\" id=\"\">group dynamics</a>.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">When Laughter Isn't Appropriate in Therapy</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Laughing in therapy certainly has its role. But, like with most things, overdoing it (or relying on a good joke at the wrong time) can adversely affect the therapeutic process. In most cases, laughter isn't appropriate during the following situations:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Attempting to diffuse or distract emotion: </strong>It's essential that clients have unrestricted access to tap into their emotional states within therapy. Jokes may break up some of the awkwardness of therapy, but it's a therapist's job to model being comfortable with uncomfortable material.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Meeting your own satisfaction/desires: </strong>Therapists need to be mindful of their own countertransference reactions when working with clients. Some clients use their sense of humor as a way to cope with pain, and therapists may have similar patterns in their own lives. Therapists need to always consider if and how laughter benefits their clients.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Engaging in fake laughter: </strong>Authentic reactions are important in therapy, and there's such a nuanced difference between the expression of real and fake laughter. Incongruent behavior can cause ruptures within the therapeutic process, which can worsen clinical outcomes</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Avoiding important topics: </strong>Humor can be a form of avoidance, and therapists need to be careful of playing into enactments or inadvertently enabling withdrawal patterns.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapeutic laughter often helps facilitate therapeutic breakthroughs and can deepen the connection between therapist and client. Therapists are, of course, humans, and showing this human side may offer a transformative experience within clinical work.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Customer relationship management (CRM) first appeared as an essential concept in the commercial world. It was a term to denote managing, developing, and analyzing customer interactions with a company to promote loyalty and increase profits. By using technology, CRM systems help organize, automate, and coordinate sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support. Moreover, they enable companies to keep track of customer interactions, manage customer data, and automate marketing and sales tasks.</p><p id=\"\">The privatization of medical practices introduced CRM to the healthcare world as it became essential to assist professionals in forging stronger relationships with patients by providing retention-enhancing acquisition solutions. </p><p id=\"\">Today, the behavioral health field utilizes CRM to track customer interactions, identify areas where they need improvement, and improve customer service overall. </p><p id=\"\">The bottom line for using CRM software remains the same in the commercial and healthcare worlds: exceptional value for clients.</p><h2 id=\"\">Benefits of CRM for Behavioral health care providers.</h2><p id=\"\">In today's hectic and cutthroat society, many people place high importance on their mental health. The stigma associated with obtaining mental health treatment has considerably decreased, and now everyone is trying to look after their psychological needs.</p><p id=\"\">The market for mental health was estimated to be worth 383.31 billion US dollars in 2020. With a CAGR of 3.5%, it is predicted to reach 537.97 billion USD by 2030. This rapidly increasing demand ought to make it difficult for clinics to manage and provide for their consumers if they continue to rely on human resources or outdated tools to meet the forthcoming patient requirements. </p><p id=\"\">Hence, it's critical to recognize the value of CRM and comprehend its advantages to use the tool to its fullest potential. Here are a few:</p><h2 id=\"\">Increased customer satisfaction.</h2><p id=\"\">Using CRM, healthcare providers can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and increase customer retention rates.</p><p id=\"\">One way is automating tasks that previously required support staff, freeing up valuable time for care providers. CRM systems can automate tasks like patient reminders and follow-up emails.</p><p id=\"\">It does so by allowing providers to manage their relationships with patients. This, in turn, helps providers engage with patients more meaningfully. &nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Improved communication. </h2><p id=\"\">CRM systems provide a platform for providers to coordinate care and share information with other care team members. Communication between providers and patients, as well as between providers and other providers, is also aided by the software. CRM systems have the ability to schedule appointments, keep track of a patient’s medications and progress, manage patient check-ins, and monitor their vitals. It is vital for healthcare providers, patients, and other team members to know all these so everyone is on the same page. </p><p id=\"\">Moreover, the system sends notifications and reminders to inform therapists of important dates, like a patient's birthday, when a card or message would be appreciated.</p><h2 id=\"\">Better care and lower costs. </h2><p id=\"\">Since CRM can help organizations improve communication, manage schedules and appointments, and track client progress, the need to retain staff for these specific jobs is reduced, lowering costs. On the other hand, the quality of care is improved because the team is provided with quick and easy access to client records. Human errors are also minimized, which could have affected the efficiency of care and increased costs otherwise. Additionally, CRM systems can generate reports that help identify gaps in care, areas for improvement, and any potential red flags for the organization, helping it provide better care to clients.</p><h2 id=\"\">Streamlines processes for a better customer base.</h2><p id=\"\">Behavioral healthcare organizations have historically lacked good customer relationship management tools. As a result, staff has had to rely on ad hoc methods for managing patient data. This has led to inefficiencies in patient care and made it difficult for behavioral healthcare organizations to maintain good patient relationships. </p><p id=\"\">However, for a rapidly growing industry like behavioral healthcare, these issues could lead a firm working in the industry to be driven out. Thus, streamlining healthcare processes is a necessity to improve efficiency and stay up-to-date with changing trends. </p><p id=\"\">Fortunately, CRM tools can help behavioral healthcare organizations overcome these challenges by providing a centralized repository for patient data, improving communication between staff and patients, and facilitating the delivery of care. </p><p id=\"\">Additionally, they also allow healthcare providers to have a complete view of their interactions with a customer, from the first contact to the most recent one. This gives them the ability to provide better customer service and improve retention rates. </p><h2 id=\"\">Reconnects with former patients.</h2><p id=\"\">When a client completes therapy, they may decide (or be forced) to stop going for personal reasons or external factors in their life. CRM can assist in reconnecting disconnected patients to ensure they are not permanently lost.</p><p id=\"\">CRM software comes with the option of arranging patient data according to your own unique criteria, like “previous clients”. This makes it simpler to check in or reconnect with lost patients.</p><p id=\"\">On a personal level, former patients could appreciate the gesture, enhancing the firm's image and increasing the likelihood of recommendations.</p><h2 id=\"\">Targeted marketing campaigns.</h2><p id=\"\">In addition, CRM systems can help target marketing campaigns more effectively and generate leads that are more likely to convert into customers. They do this by making crucial patient information more available to all pertinent parties, eliminating the need to repeat the same information to healthcare staff many times. </p><p id=\"\">Furthermore, CRMs assist in targeting, segmenting, and reaching out to behavioral healthcare organizations' patients. </p><p id=\"\">The client management software packages may be customized using add-ons for certain professions, such as email marketing for solopreneurs.</p><h2 id=\"\">Swift process management.</h2><p id=\"\">The job of behavioral health care providers focuses on understanding and modifying a patient’s behaviors, using a number of interventions that target social, cognitive, emotional, and environmental factors that may influence it, in order to improve the patient’s overall functioning and help them lead a more prosperous and independent life. A crucial part of managing this process is made easy by CRM, as it provides practitioners with the ability to store and remember customer data easily.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

People and their loved ones are more likely to disclose mental health concerns. They are urged to get therapy.</p><p id=\"\">Consider the following signs that you or a loved one may be experiencing a mental health disorder:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Sadness or depression</li><li id=\"\">Concentration problems</li><li id=\"\">Extreme emotions (including fear, guilt, sadness, or anger)</li><li id=\"\">Absence from social or recreational activities</li><li id=\"\">Extreme swings in mood</li><li id=\"\">Abuse of alcoholic beverages or illicit substances</li><li id=\"\">Unknown hostility or hostility</li><li id=\"\">Incapacity to cope with stress or strong emotions</li><li id=\"\">Hallucinations, delusions, or paranoia (such as hearing voices)</li><li id=\"\">Think of harming yourself or others</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">The Path to Improved Mental Health</h2><p id=\"\">There are several therapeutic approaches for mental health difficulties. Counseling and psychotherapy are examples. Similarly referred to as talk therapy. It is one of the most used treatments for mental health problems. It includes addressing your problems with a mental health professional, but it is much more than that. There is an emphasis on relaxation methods, coping skills, stress management, and an educational component. There are several types of talk therapy. CBT and DBT are examples. Individual psychotherapy is widespread. It can also be conducted in a group setting or with family members. Sometimes, individual and group talk therapy may be effective. Even individuals who do not have a mental health diagnosis but are going through a tough moment may benefit from this treatment (grief, divorce, etc.).</p><h2 id=\"\">Types of Therapies for Mental Illness</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Medication Therapy</h3><p id=\"\">Prescription medicine is an additional common therapeutic method. Medications for mental disorders change neurotransmitters involved in emotion and cognition. Medicines do not treat mental or physical disorders. However, they can assist in relieving your discomfort. They can enhance the efficacy of other treatments, including psychotherapy.

Other Therapies</h3><p id=\"\">People utilize a variety of therapy to handle mental health difficulties. Physical activity, including yoga and exercise, is one example. Additionally, creative therapy may be utilized. These are therapies that encourage creative expression. They could incorporate art, music, dancing, or literature.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Hospitals and Residential Treatment Programs</h3><p id=\"\">Your mental health issues may become so serious that you require hospitalization or long-term treatment. This might happen if you are unable to care for yourself. It also occurs when a person is in danger of causing harm to herself or others.</p><p id=\"\">Not all therapies are beneficial or necessary for all patients. Some individuals benefit from a combination of medications. Your physician will help you determine the optimal course of therapy.</p><h2 id=\"\">Is Therapy Successful?</h2><p id=\"\">Studies show that talk therapy can be highly beneficial for mental and emotional health.</p><p id=\"\">In a review of 270 trials, researchers discovered that psychotherapy was beneficial for depressed individuals and, in some cases, more effective than other treatments. Another large meta-analysis indicated that psychodynamic treatment improved patients with depression, social anxiety, and social phobias over time.</p><p id=\"\">Studies have demonstrated that therapy benefits individuals with anxiety, panic, eating, and personality disorders. One study found that therapy has long-term effects, such as fostering inner strength and helping patients live \"richer, more liberated, and more fulfilling lives.\" </p><p id=\"\">Other research has demonstrated that therapy sessions can reduce the likelihood of acquiring a later mental health condition for individuals who have experienced the death of a key loved one.</p><p id=\"\">Some people with mental illnesses (such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, or psychotic disorders) will need medications to help them manage their condition. Crawford believes that concurrent therapy may be the most effective. According to studies, people with depression gain more from therapy with medication than from alone. </p><p id=\"\">Therapy may help people with their emotional and mental health (whether they have a professional diagnosis or not) since it addresses their desired changes in thought patterns, past traumas, and behavioral patterns. Patients learn healthy coping skills and feel empowered to take control of their lives via treatment, but it requires work to master new skills.</p><p id=\"\">Notably, research demonstrates that patient-psychologist contact is essential. According to a meta-analysis of 295 studies and more than 30,000 patients, patients will benefit best from therapy in a setting characterized by high levels of connection, reliability, and collaboration. This means that your therapist should ideally be aware of your long-term mental health goals, and you should feel comfortable discussing how you will handle your challenges together.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Bottom Line</h2><p id=\"\">Do not hesitate to ask for help.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Life can be hard sometimes. Sometimes all the noise and activity get to you. It can make you feel tense, worried, sad, or afraid of the unknown, hurting your mental health. Managing your emotions and dealing with the problems you face every day is important for your overall health, but it can be hard to do.</p><p id=\"\">Seeking professional help is one option for caring for your mental health, but taking care of your emotional and mental well-being may also mean doing the small things that add to a significant impact.</p><h2 id=\"\">What is Mental Health?</h2><p id=\"\">Our mental health comprises our emotional, mental, and social well-being. It changes how we think, feel, and act when facing life problems. It also affects how we handle stress, deal with other people, and make choices. Mental health is crucial in all phases of life, from childhood to adulthood and old age.</p><p id=\"\">You can improve your mental health in several ways, such as:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Maintain a Positive Attitude</h3><p id=\"\">A morning routine is helpful, but it's also important to start the day on a good note. Whether you are grateful to yourself, or something else, it can help your mental and emotional health.</p><p id=\"\">Instead of opening your social networking apps as soon as you wake up, take a moment to compliment yourself or thank something or someone. You could also do both! Having feelings of self-worth can greatly affect your mood, and keeping a gratitude book can help you feel happy and at peace.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Maintain Your Focus</h3><p id=\"\">It's easy to get stuck in \"what-if\" thoughts. Why me? What will happen next?</p><p id=\"\">But these questions might take your mind off of living your life and doing the things you need to do. Studies have shown that \"a mind that wanders is an unhappy mind.\" Don't worry about what isn't happening now; pay attention to what is. The coffee is ready for you. This new playlist looks like it could be fun. Your dog has a lot of fur on it today. This banana is ready to eat.</p><p id=\"\">Focusing on sounds, smells, tastes, or sights in your body can help calm your busy mind and ground you in the here and now.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Exercise</h3><p id=\"\">We all know that regular exercise is important if you want to stay at a healthy weight, and you may also know that it's good for your heart. On the other hand, exercise improves your brain by making it smarter, making you happier, and reducing stress and anxiety.</p><p id=\"\">Endorphins are released when you work out, which makes you feel better. It also makes more dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine come out, all of which help keep your mood stable. For instance, the rush of serotonin you get from working out might help you feel better. Also, exercise helps keep your adrenaline levels in check, which can help you feel less stressed.</p><p id=\"\">This means that even 20 minutes of exercise daily can help you deal with stress and improve your mental health. It's also a great way to feel like you've done something and to take charge of your life when things are uncertain.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Eat Foods That Are Good For You</h3><p id=\"\">Your brain is one of the most active parts of your body, and it needs the right food to work at its best.</p><p id=\"\">Eating well-balanced meals full of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants will help you feel and work better. A healthy diet includes fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats. Notice that this list doesn't include processed foods, which may have a lot of refined sugars and saturated fats. If you need something more specific than a list and want a healthy diet to help you stay on track, think about the Mediterranean diet.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Socialize</h3><p id=\"\">During the COVID-19 epidemic, people needed to live apart from each other, but that doesn't mean they have to be alone. During the epidemic, there are several ways to stay in touch with friends and family. These include talking on the phone, video chatting, and other digital tools.</p><p id=\"\">This is important because, like many animals, people are social creatures. It is recommended that the number and quality of our social contacts affect our mental health, so keeping in touch with people is important.</p><p id=\"\">When you're socializing, you might talk to someone about a problem or issue or just be nice to them in general. Putting your trust in others and getting others to trust you can help your emotional health and self-esteem. Being nice to people, even if you don't know them, makes you happier and can boost your self-esteem.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Set Some Goals For Yourself</h3><p id=\"\">Nothing beats the feeling of success. Whether your goal is to lose 10 pounds, save for a down payment, or get that promotion you've been eyeing, achieving it may boost your self-esteem and sense of worth.</p><p id=\"\">When setting goals, one thing to keep in mind is to ensure they are realistic. Your goals should be hard, but they should also align with what you're good at. Also, make sure you have the time and energy to put toward reaching your goals. If you want to do something but aren't sure if it will work, try it out as a hobby first.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Pay Attention To Your Sleep</h3><p id=\"\">Most nights, choosing that TV show you recorded might be easy instead of going to bed. But the voice in your head that tells you to go to bed is usually right.</p><p id=\"\">Not getting enough sleep and bad sleep can have a big effect on how you feel the next day. It could make you more irritable and make it hard for you to focus on your work. This means you must ensure you get enough sleep every night. It's also important to prepare for a good night's sleep, such as by not staring at your electronics before bed.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Don't Feel Bad About Asking For Help</h3><p id=\"\">It's hard to admit you're having trouble, but there's no shame in doing so.</p><p id=\"\">If your stress, sadness, or bad feelings worsen, you should talk to a friend or family member. Talking to someone about your worries might help you understand them better and take some of the stress off your shoulders. It may also help you get along better with someone else, especially if they are going through similar problems. You can feel better by doing any of these things.</p><p id=\"\">If you are worried about your mental health, you should talk to a doctor or someone who specializes in mental health.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Time is the most precious and irreplaceable commodity. But if you’re like most therapists, your days often feel cramped and full. You might be managing back-to-back sessions with little to no downtime. In more acute settings, when it feels like there's always a fire to extinguish, ongoing crises can make it challenging to discern the most important tasks.</p><p id=\"\">Good time management strategies are essential for protecting your well-being and mitigating burnout. If you don't look after yourself, you risk becoming emotionally exhausted. This can have serious consequences for both your clients and your loved ones.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some ways to stay focused without sacrificing your own mental health.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Top Time Management Tips for Therapists</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Just like you want your clients to find a sense of balance in their lives, it's important that you prioritize how you manage your time. This priority transcends beyond how you maintain a daily schedule. Therapists need the mental energy to give to their clients, and that comes down to integrating these important mental shifts.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Make Your To-Do List Everyday</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Use one master calendar for everything, and use that calendar to track what you need to do each day. Ideally, you should include any professional, personal, or familial commitments.</p><p id=\"\">Scheduling is everything- and not just when it comes to managing your clients. You also need to appropriately schedule time for notes, meetings, networking, and outreach. You should also consider scheduling lunches with friends, visits with family, and various appointments. If it's not written down, it might not get done.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Focus on One Task at a Time</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Research shows that only about 2.5% of the population can actually multitask effectively. And yet, so many of us try to juggle multiple items at the same time.</p><p id=\"\">As a therapist, you know the importance of staying present and engaged with your clients. This same mindset should apply to your administrative tasks as well. Even if they feel tedious, you'll get things done so much faster if you aren't distracting yourself every few moments.</p><p id=\"\">If a certain task feels overwhelming, set a time limit. For example, consider allocating half an hour to tackle paperwork. Once those thirty minutes are up, decide whether you want to continue working on that task or move on to something else.</p><p id=\"\">Don't forget to schedule breaks. People with strong time management skills know they don't have infinite energy. They honor the need for time limits, breaks, and restoration throughout the day.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Optimize Your Time Management Tools</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Technology has redefined how we measure and track time. Use these tools to your advantage- they will help you with everything from project management to working through demanding tasks to taking regular breaks.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some tracking tools to consider:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Asana: </strong>This is a project management tool that allows you to focus on various tasks, projects, and productivity goals.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Toggl: </strong>Toggl is a time-tracking tool for small businesses and individual professionals that specifically allows you to manage how much time an individual project takes. This can be especially important for managing paperwork or other work-related meetings. You can also use tracking data to give yourself a time audit.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Evernote: </strong>Evernote helps you organize notes and memos in one place. You can also collaborate with your coworkers to build teams. In addition, it can read your handwriting- perfect for if you're jotting down quick notes with a client.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">RescueTime: </strong>RescueTime is specific time management software that offers analytics for your web activity. This may help cut down on procrastination/distraction and encourage you to be more productive at work.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Eliminate the Idea of a Perfect Work-Life Balance</strong></h3><p id=\"\">There's really no such thing as perfection when it comes to time management. You can (and should) strive for a better work-life balance, but it's important to have realistic expectations for yourself.</p><p id=\"\">This is why having a working to-do list can be so important. When you know what's essential each day, you can focus your energy on what matters most. This helps you avoid wasting time, and it can make your overall workday feel more productive.</p><p id=\"\">Getting clear on your values can help. When you know what's most valuable to you, it becomes easier to recognize when you must outsource, delegate, or simply eliminate. The reality is that you will never have time to manage it all.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Eliminate Visual Clutter</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Research suggests that clutter exacerbates stress levels and can reduce the ability to focus. It also contributes to cognitive overload, and this applies whether you're seeing clients in person or via telehealth.</p><p id=\"\">If the space feels cluttered, you might also feel cluttered. Make it a point to clean your desk each day. Place aesthetically-pleasing items in your office. And if you're working from home, make sure your workspace is separately defined from the rest of your living quarters.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Accept Some Days Will Be Better Than Others</strong></h3><p id=\"\">While it doesn't feel good to miss deadlines or run late or get caught up in long, distracting phone calls, the reality is that you're only human. You'll be more productive at various times.</p><p id=\"\">Mastering time management often feels like a process of trial and error. And unexpected tasks will still land on your desk. That's just what it means to be a therapist. Your time management strategy, therefore, needs to be flexible enough that it allows for wiggle room.</p><p id=\"\">Finally, don't underestimate your own energy levels. When is it easiest for you to concentrate? Try to tackle your <em id=\"\">most important, high-priority tasks </em>when you have the greatest mental bandwidth to handle them. Save the low-priority tasks for when your energy naturally dips.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Small steps can make a big difference in how you maximize productivity and maintain a sense of balance in your daily life.</p><p id=\"\">The more you can eliminate distractions, prioritize tasks, and break bad habits impacting your well-being, the better you will feel at effectively managing your time.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">How much should I charge for my therapy services? </em>If you're asking yourself this question,</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we'll review the best practices for setting private practice fees and review which common mistakes to avoid.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Due Diligence In Therapy Fee Setting</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Conducting extensive market research is the first step to setting your therapist fee. You'll want to dedicate at least 1-2 hours to studying what other therapists are charging in your local area. In addition to tracking geographical data, you also want to consider how long they've been practicing, their current areas of specialty, and what specific services they offer.</p><p id=\"\">Market research has its nuances to consider. Some therapists determine the median number and then charge slightly less than other providers. They often have the belief that a cheaper fee will attract more clients. And while that may be the case, if you set your fee too low, you might struggle financially or become resentful of your rate.</p><p id=\"\">Other therapists decide to charge more than other therapists. This can be beneficial if you have the qualifications and confidence to match this rate. However, it may take longer to build your practice, and you might be priced too high for certain kinds of clients.</p><p id=\"\">In doing your due diligence, you want to consider who your ideal therapy client is and how likely they are to pay your rate. There's no magic formula for this, but over time, you will develop a sense of building your fee structure for current and potential clients.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Considering Your Own Lifestyle and Financial Goals When Setting Therapy Fees</strong></h2><p id=\"\">It's true that private practice therapists get to determine their own fees, but the catch is that you're solely responsible for ensuring your own financial well-being.</p><p id=\"\">Before setting fees, consider these important factors:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How many clients you want to see: </strong>Burnout can be a significant pitfall for therapists, and high caseloads can certainly increase the risk of burnout occurring. Many therapists find that working with fewer clients (and charging slightly higher rates) allows them to be more present and engaged with their work.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How many hours you want to work: </strong>Will your private practice be a full-time endeavor? Or are you seeking to see just a few clients in addition to other income streams? Knowing these answers can provide you with a helpful roadmap as you set fees.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Your personal budget and monetary goals: </strong>Unfortunately, it's often considered taboo for therapists to embrace having a money mindset. But your financial wellness matters. If you're struggling with money, that can affect every part of your well-being, and it can trickle into your work with clients.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Vacation time and personal time off: </strong>You need to consider how many weeks a year you will realistically plan to work. Consider any vacations, sick time, and personal time off. When you have your own practice, it's unrealistic to work every single day of the year!</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reassess Your Practice Fees and Expenses</strong></h2><p id=\"\">It isn't enough to simply consider your income goals when establishing your fee. You also need to factor in how various expenses will affect your overall profit. If you aren't already tracking business costs, you need to start as soon as possible. Owning your own business means tracking</p><p id=\"\">The most common monthly expenses include:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Office rent: </strong>It's also important to include any furnishings, decor, and basic office essentials within this fee.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Marketing costs: </strong>Marketing costs can include anything from directory listings to business cards to website costs to networking expenses.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Practice management software: </strong>Any software that you use for your business is an expense (including the Internet). If you're paying too much for EMR, consider reevaluating your system. At Navix Health,<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/sales-pricing\" id=\"\"> we offer low pricing</a> that starts as low as 29.99/month, and we also have free trials for all new users.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Continuing education courses: </strong>All therapists need to complete CEUs to maintain good standing with their licensing boards and stay up-to-date with current trends. Any professional training or workshop should be noted as a business expense.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Liability insurance: </strong>You are required to have liability insurance as a private practice therapist. The cost of this insurance is also a business expense.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Supervision and consultation costs: </strong>If you pay for supervision or consultation, these are considered business expenses, and they are important to track.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Health insurance: </strong>The cost of your insurance premium is generally considered a business expense. However, there may be some exceptions, so always consult with an accountant to review healthcare-related costs.</p><p id=\"\">If your expenses feel too high, consider areas where you can cut back. However, keep in mind that most therapists operating cash-pay practices need to spend more money to attract clients and advertise their business. This is especially true if you're in the beginning stages of building your therapy practice.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sliding Scale Rates</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Many therapists choose to have a few sliding scale slots in their practice. There's no hard rule that states you <em id=\"\">have </em>to do this, but it can certainly help make therapy services more accessible, and it can be an easy option for starting a cash-pay practice.</p><p id=\"\">Keep in mind that, if you work with insurance panels, you may not be able to offer this sliding scale. You need to check the insurance providers' contracts. Some will prohibit therapists from charging a lower rate to cash-pay clients than insurance clients.</p><p id=\"\">If you opt to have a sliding scale, you need to consider how you will discern this specific fee. Some therapists seek proof of income, while others base this fee using an honor system. Keep in mind it's usually helpful to reassess this fee throughout the therapeutic process.</p><p id=\"\">In addition or instead of a standard sliding scale option, some therapists choose to:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Offer pay-what-you-can therapy services: </strong>You can reserve some therapy session fees to honor a pay-what-you-can model. You might want to provide a minimum payment, or you can leave it completely up to the client's discretion. Some therapists also choose to maintain a few pro bono sessions in their practice.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Set up payment plans: </strong>If a client faces sudden financial hardship, you might want to offer a payment plan to allow them to continue meeting with you without paying your normal session rate each week.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Give back to the community in other ways: </strong>It may not be feasible to have sliding scale rates. Some therapists choose to give back by getting involved in advocacy, volunteering their time, or donating money to good causes.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Determine Your Cancellation Policy</strong></h2><p id=\"\">No-shows and cancellations can get costly and may seriously affect your bottom line. These can cost more than just the ordinary session cost. No-shows also represent lost opportunity costs- you could have better scheduled that time for other commitments or sessions.</p><p id=\"\">The industry standard for most therapists is to charge a cancellation fee if a client cancels a session with less than 24 hours' notice. Some therapists set this time to 48 or 72 hours, but you need to do what feels right to you.</p><p id=\"\">Consider how and when you want to make exceptions and outline those in your informed consent policy. For example, most therapists will not charge a client for missing a session if they are seriously ill or if an emergency arises. That said, if it's a consistent issue with a certain client, you may need to revisit your therapy process or boundaries with them.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">When to Raise Your Session Fee Rates</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Inflation is a constant threat to every occupation, and just as most employees need consistent raises to keep up with economic trends, private practice therapists also must consider how they give themselves raises. If you don't, you risk giving yourself a pay cut.</p><p id=\"\">Therapists have different strategies for raising rates, but here are some common approaches:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Raising fees on an annual basis: </strong>This is the simplest and most straightforward method. However, it's important to consider how and when you will tell existing clients about the cost increase. Ideally, you want to provide reasonable notice. If you suspect certain clients may not be able to afford the new fee, it's essential you both have time to review other options and provide appropriate referrals if needed.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Raising fees for new clients: </strong>Some therapists choose to raise their rates for new clients while keeping their existing clients at their original fees. The most important consideration in this approach is ensuring that you aren't discriminating against any specific client demographic.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Raising fees based on specialization/expertise: </strong>Every year you practice brings more experience and knowledge. With that, it's entirely reasonable to raise rates based on your skill set and your general advancements in the field.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Raising fees when you're almost full or at capacity: </strong>If you continue to be full in your practice, it may be time to consider increasing your session rates. Your caseload already speaks to the fact that people are willing to pay your current rate.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts On How to Set Private Practice Fees</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Private practice therapists should be both mindful and educated when setting their fees. Make sure to do your research and charge a rate that feels equitable to you. Remember that it's normal to increase your fees over time. Finally, don't apologize for charging your professional worth.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we help simplify the work for all mental health clinicians.

As a healthcare provider, it's important to note that many of your clients may already be pursuing these apps on their own. It may be helpful to assess which apps they use at the onset of treatment, as this will allow you to learn more about their purpose.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some of the main benefits associated with the best mental health apps:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increased accessibility: </strong>Some of the best mental app technology is either free or low-cost. Many of them treat a variety of mental health conditions and can provide immediate stress relief and coping skills. This alone can increase mental health care to broader populations, and users can access important data from the comfort of their own homes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increased mental health awareness: </strong>Such apps may also increase global awareness of mental health issues, which can decrease stigmatization and barriers to seeking treatment.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Client empowerment: </strong>Mental health apps can help clients feel proactive about their treatment. Therapy sessions are inherently limited, but clients can<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-self-care-tips-for-managing-therapist-burnout\" id=\"\"> practice self-care</a>, reduce stress, record negative thoughts, and track symptoms in between appointments. Implementing these apps can be a vital component in improving a client's overall well-being.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Medication management services: </strong>Medication management can be a vital part of overall mental health treatment. Some apps triage medical professionals with the client's primary care doctor and/or their licensed therapist to ensure medication compliance.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Customized support: </strong>Many app developers use<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/implementing-ai-and-machine-learning-in-behavioral-health-management\" id=\"\"> artificial intelligence and machine learning</a> to predict user behavior and integrate data into individualized mental health services. These apps learn to \"read\" the client and can then provide them with the best mental health support, coping skills, and recommendations.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Risks of Mental Health Apps</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Technology is not a substitute for working with a mental health professional. Clients with complex presenting issues or those who are experiencing acute distress need immediate support. Mental health apps may not provide the comprehensive screening or intervention needed to provide useful care.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Not enough during a mental health crisis:</strong><a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong>Mental health crises</a> can happen quickly, and while many mental health apps provide support and validation, they can't adequately support people during these vulnerable moments. This is especially true if someone's safety is on the line.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Information overload: </strong>Some people feel overwhelmed when parsing through the top mental health apps to find what best works for their needs. With so many options available, how does one pick the best choice? While education is an important component of mental health treatment, inundating people with mental health topics can make people feel even more anxious.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Unregulated online therapy: </strong>It's important to be mindful of apps that promise to provide professional therapy at discounted rates. While clinical psychologists or licensed therapists may be on these sites, clients should be aware of the risks of working with an online therapy provider employed through such companies. Their confidentiality and data may not be secure, and a high turnover of clinicians can cause inherent problems during the course of treatment.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Best Mental Health Apps to Consider Reviewing</strong></h2><p id=\"\">While mental health providers can't stay on top of every available app, we've rounded up some of the most popular options worth exploring. Remember that what makes mental health apps effective isn't how many downloads it has or how much it costs- it's about how willing your clients are to commit to using them to improve their mental wellness.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">MoodKit: </strong>MoodKit was designed by clinical psychologists and is rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy CBT). The app includes 200+ exercises intended to change negative thinking patterns and improve mood.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Headspace: </strong>Headspace is a meditation app that can help people implement more mindfulness exercises into their daily lives. The app includes guided imageries, breathing exercises, and standalone meditations for all different topics.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Happify: </strong>Happify focuses on helping people overcome negative thoughts, implement more mindfulness, and practice the tenets of positive psychology. There are both paid and free versions of the app.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Recovery Record: </strong>Recovery Record is one of the most well-known apps for helping people recover from eating disorders. This app can be connected to a client's therapist so they can mutually track progress via food diaries, coping skills, and<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/goal-setting-in-therapy-empowering-client-success\" id=\"\"> goal-setting</a>.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">NOCD: </strong>NOCD offers live video therapy sessions with obsessive-compulsive disorder specialists. Clients can easily sign up for online therapy sessions or use the app as a supplement to their normal treatment.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">PTSD Coach: </strong>PTSD coach was originally designed for combat veterans, but the app can be beneficial for anyone experiencing trauma symptoms. It provides self-assessment tools, personalized feedback, and ongoing coping skills.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">eMoods Bipolar Mood Tracker: </strong>This app is intended to help people with bipolar disorder track their mood and mental health symptoms seamlessly.

As AI technologies continue to evolve, we are witnessing revolutionary changes in how we manage, diagnose, and treat various health conditions. One field that is poised to benefit significantly from these advancements is behavioral health.</p><h3 id=\"\">AI in Behavioral Health: Enter Navix Health</h3><p id=\"\">Take the example of Navix Health, a company that's harnessing the power of AI to transform behavioral health management. Navix Health has developed a comprehensive, unified platform for behavioral health software, powered by AI. The system effectively reduces administrative burdens, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on what truly matters: providing optimal patient care​1​.</p><p id=\"\">But this isn't just any AI; it's a Large Language Model (LLM). LLMs are a type of AI model trained on a wide range of internet text. They understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive, making them extremely useful in a variety of applications.</p><p id=\"\">Navix Health employs LLM in its NavixAI feature, which improves the quality of notes, summaries, and suggested diagnostic codes. This not only enhances the efficiency of clinical documentation but also aids in delivering more accurate and personalized patient care​1​.</p><h3 id=\"\">The Benefits of LLM in Behavioral Health</h3><p id=\"\">The implementation of LLM AI in behavioral health can bring numerous benefits. First, it can streamline documentation. With an AI-powered system, changing a name in demographics can auto-populate throughout the system and documents, saving significant time and minimizing errors​1​.</p><p id=\"\">LLMs can also support healthcare professionals in decision-making processes. By analyzing patient data, the AI can identify patterns and make recommendations, such as potential treatment strategies or risk factors to monitor.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, AI systems like NavixAI can aid in diagnostic processes. By analyzing patient information and clinical notes, the AI can suggest possible diagnoses, supporting clinicians in their assessment processes and ensuring nothing gets overlooked​1​.</p><h3 id=\"\">The Future of Behavioral Health with LLM AI</h3><p id=\"\">As we look ahead, the impact of LLM AI in behavioral health is likely to grow. The use of AI can lead to more personalized care plans, improved patient outcomes, and overall enhanced efficiency in healthcare delivery.</p><p id=\"\">However, it's important to note that the role of AI is to support, not replace, healthcare professionals. The human touch, intuition, and empathy that professionals bring to patient care can never be replicated by AI. But with AI handling more administrative tasks and providing additional insights, professionals can focus more on their patients, providing the compassionate care they need.</p><p id=\"\">In summary, the integration of Large Language Model AI into behavioral health management represents a significant step forward in the field. As companies like Navix Health continue to innovate, we can anticipate a future where technology and human expertise work hand in hand to deliver the best possible patient care.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

Every relationship is inherently unique, but when clients reflect on what makes therapy <em id=\"\">work </em>for them, they often speak about the nuances within this relationship.</p><p id=\"\">All treatment modalities talk about the significance of the therapeutic alliance. But therapists sometimes overlook the nuts and bolts when forming this meaningful relationship. Here are some common mistakes that you may need to consider addressing in your work.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Undermining the Importance of the Therapeutic Relationship</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Regardless of your theoretical orientation, the alliance matters and this is true in all forms of therapy, including individual, family, couple, and group therapy. How you connect and support your client should always be at the forefront of your work.</p><p id=\"\">That said, therapists working in short-term care or more acute mental health treatment might overlook the value of this relationship. In addition, insurance companies have entirely different standards for measuring treatment success, which can complicate the process altogether.</p><p id=\"\">In all cases, however, the therapeutic relationship acts as the catalyst for stabilizing crises, improving mental health symptoms, and maintaining retention within a treatment episode. And no matter what they're working on, people who enjoy a collaborative relationship with their therapists are more likely to have positive outcomes when it comes to achieving their therapeutic goals.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Falsely Believing the Client Trusts Them Quickly</strong></h3><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">I've never told anyone this before.</em></p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">You're so much better than all my last therapists.</em></p><p id=\"\"><em id=\"\">I feel like you really understand me.</em></p><p id=\"\">Therapists naturally enjoy hearing these statements and client feedback matters, but it's important to avoid automatically assuming that praise indicates trust. The truth is that clients often come to treatment feeling deeply betrayed by people whom they cared about. They also may have long-standing issues with medical providers, making it harder for them to trust a therapist's ability to help them.</p><p id=\"\">That said, trust is earned one moment at a time. Consistency, reliability, and compassion can't be overstated. In addition, you can erode trust rapidly- sometimes within a single statement. Recognizing and respecting the fragility of trust reminds you to keep focusing on building a good therapeutic alliance.</p><p id=\"\">In all cases, it's unlikely that any client will fully trust you within just a few sessions. The therapy process takes time to unfold, and it's important to accept trust as an evolving concept.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Address Therapeutic Alliance Ruptures</strong></h2><p id=\"\">A therapeutic alliance rupture can best be described as an experience of tension within the relationship. Anything can cause this rupture, from you arriving at the session a few minutes late to you wearing an outfit that reminds them of an ex-partner. However, the tension can be incredibly covert, and many clients won't address it directly themselves.</p><p id=\"\">Psychotherapy research also shows that good therapy isn't about the absence of ruptures. How therapists attend to ruptures is what's key. One study even found that treatment outcomes were <em id=\"\">more </em>successful when a client and therapist navigated a rupture successfully compared to clients who always had a strong therapeutic relationship. This work is known as the<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5966286/#:~:text=Repairing%20a%20rupture%20in%20session,directly%20on%20the%20alliance%20rupture.\" id=\"\"> rupture-repair process</a>, and it can be transformative within a helping alliance.</p><p id=\"\">Signs that a rupture may have occurred include your client:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">becoming more withdrawn and/or avoidant in therapy</li><li id=\"\">making more sarcastic jokes or refusing to share their feelings more candidly</li><li id=\"\">canceling sessions or not showing up at all</li><li id=\"\">criticizing you or the therapy process</li><li id=\"\">blaming themselves for not being \"good enough\" in some way for therapy</li></ul><p id=\"\">Therapists can best attend to relationship ruptures by addressing them quickly and professionally. This also entails acknowledging your own wrongdoings and holding yourself accountable for how you hurt a client. Throughout this process, let your client explain themselves fully without assuming you know how they feel.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Inadvertently Disagreeing on Treatment Goals</strong></h2><p id=\"\">A good therapeutic relationship requires that you're on your client's team. A client genuinely needs to feel like you believe in their goals (and them) wholeheartedly.</p><p id=\"\">Therefore, problems can quickly emerge when you have a goal for the client that they don't yet for themselves. For example, a client seeks your expertise in helping them recover from their substance use disorder. And while they make some strides in therapy, they refuse to end a problematic relationship with their abusive partner. You believe this dynamic is profoundly stunting their recovery efforts.</p><p id=\"\">That said, it's essential that you don't conflate your biases with actual therapy goals. You can and should present your concerns, particularly when it comes to safety, but it's essential to respect your client for their needs, values, and current life situation.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Fostering Dependency Within The Therapeutic Bond</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists must always be mindful of how clients can grow to depend on their therapists for emotional support and safety. In some frameworks, this reliance initially acts as an important foundation. But when clients lack outside resources or support, the therapeutic process can backfire.</p><p id=\"\">In a positive therapeutic alliance, you're acting as compassionate support as they process emotions, cope with distress, or navigate making important changes. At the same time, you always encourage autonomy and take on a strengths-based approach. Setting and maintaining professional boundaries maintains attachment without exploiting safety.</p><p id=\"\">With that, you remain aware of the potential for deep transference. It's common for clients to feel a combination of shame, fear, sadness, anger, and confusion regarding how they feel about therapy. Encouraging exploration of these feelings and validating their role is a crucial part of maintaining a working alliance.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Creating and maintaining a strong therapeutic alliance is an essential goal for every therapy client. Within treatment, true healing happens within the context of a healing relationship.</p><p id=\"\">Therapists are sometimes the only person really listening to a client's needs and feelings. By providing unconditional positive regard, validation, and safety, you allow someone to be themselves and explore the changes they value most.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "blog-content": "When there is milieu-based care, each member of the team has specific responsibility for crisis management. But even in outpatient settings, where crises may be less typical, therapists still need to have clear guidelines.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Every therapist needs to be prepared to assess, manage, and reconcile crises. In more acute settings, clinicians are generally trained to adhere to established protocols. When there is milieu-based care, each member of the team has specific responsibility for crisis management. But even in outpatient settings, where crises may be less typical, therapists still need to have clear guidelines.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Defining a Client Crisis</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The definition of a crisis can be subjective, and a client's perception of a crisis can be much different than a therapist's perception. Generally speaking, a crisis represents the \"risk of imminent harm or danger\" in a client's life.</p><p id=\"\">Clients in crises feel overwhelmed by their thoughts and feelings, and are at a greater risk for relapse and emotional decompensation. Crises can escalate quickly, and symptoms can ebb and flow in the immediate aftermath.</p><p id=\"\">It is not the therapist's job to fix a crisis. However, it is a therapist's responsibility to be aware of the legal and ethical implications of such management. Mishandling crises can adversely impact the therapeutic relationship and impact a client's overall safety.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Review Informed Consent Information</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Informed consent refers to providing substantial information about the therapeutic process. All therapists must review these policies before initiating treatment with new clients. It's also important for therapists to invite clients to ask any questions they have about their treatment protocol.</p><p id=\"\">That said, informed consent is rarely a one-time conversation; instead, the rules and expectations should regularly be discussed, especially when different circumstances arise. When it comes to safety and crisis issues, informed consent should outline:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">state confidentiality laws regarding abuse reporting</li><li id=\"\">state confidentiality laws regarding suicidal and homicidal safety</li><li id=\"\">policies about releases of information and what they do/do not entail</li><li id=\"\">therapist availability between sessions (i.e. emergency plans)</li><li id=\"\">realistic expectations/general intentions of the therapeutic process</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Proper Risk and Safety Assessment</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Every therapist needs to have specific strategies for discerning risk and evaluating safety. Proper assessments should be administered at the onset of treatment and any time a therapist has a concern about a client's well-being.</p><p id=\"\">It's essential to model being comfortable talking about sensitive topics directly. Many clients feel uncomfortable disclosing anything that triggers a sense of shame. A strong therapeutic relationship requires a sense of mutual respect and safety- aiming to prioritize a deeper understanding of the client's needs while also measuring their current well-being helps to strike this balance.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Safety Planning</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Creating a safety plan with a client fosters client autonomy and can empower them to cope adaptively during heightened moments. Research supports that<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33913799/\" id=\"\"> safety planning interventions</a> are positively associated with reduced suicidal ideation and suicide-related outcomes.</p><p id=\"\">A safety plan should include immediate crisis phone numbers for the local emergency room and national helplines. Clients should also identify 2-3 supportive people they can contact when experiencing a crisis. Finally, it's helpful to list immediate coping strategies that can help stabilize acute distress.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Thorough Documentation</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapist records need to be up-to-date, relevant, and competent enough should they face legal scrutiny. This is the standard for every therapy session, but it becomes even more important when crisis issues arise.</p><p id=\"\">Documentation should always be as clear and concise as possible. All notes should reflect current clinical outcomes, goals, and interventions. Accuracy at all levels is essential. If you choose to use any abbreviations, make sure they have universal relevance. Anyone reading clinical notes should be able to easily understand the written content.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consult For More Support</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists who work as solo practitioners need to be connected to outside support. Supervision and consultation groups provide an external perspective when managing crisis issues.</p><p id=\"\">Therapists should also extend their network to other medical professionals, including physicians, psychiatrists, and specific clinical specialists. When working with children and adolescents, collaborations with parents and teachers can be invaluable.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Follow-Up Care</strong></h2><p id=\"\">After a crisis passes, a client is still in a tender state of mind. In fact, many people struggle more profoundly after the initial shock and adrenaline wanes. It's important for therapists to be mindful of their clients' emotional states and be meticulous in their ongoing assessments.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Continue assessing mental health status: </strong>Assess for suicidal/homicidal ideation at each session. Clients with histories of psychosis or significant mental health issues may need extra monitoring.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Monitor acute symptoms: </strong>Note any symptoms that may be worsening. Be mindful of symptoms like dissociation, panic attacks, increased substance use, or extreme anger at this time.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increase session frequency: </strong>Many clients benefit from temporarily increasing the frequency of their therapy sessions when a crisis occurs. Discuss payment options to determine if this is feasible. Therapists can also consider adding a phone or email support option. Be aware that clients may decide to reduce or stop attending sessions as a withdrawal tactic.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Engage in external resources: </strong>It's important to have crisis resources available. Encourage the client to tap into existing coping skills and their own support system.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Best Practices for Managing Crisis Issues Within the Therapy Process</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Crises are inevitable in the work of therapy. An effective therapist prepares for the possibility of such concerns from the start of the first session. As the therapy relationship progresses, they remain mindful of a client's specific needs, and they stay focused and up-to-date on current evaluation practices within the field.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Mental health treatment may make all the difference in allowing people with mental illness to enjoy healthy, fulfilling lives. But how can one evaluate whether they require medical attention? The only way to be certain is to consult a mental health professional. Consider the following signs that you may need mental health counseling. </p><p id=\"\">You may think, \"How can I determine if I require mental health treatment?\" The best way to evaluate if you need mental health treatment is to consult an expert. They can advise you on the mental health treatment programs best suit your needs. However, a few warning signs may indicate the need for mental health counseling.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Anxiety Disorder</h3><p id=\"\">We are all occasionally concerned and apprehensive. It's not all awful, however. Worry ensures that we get to work on time and do all necessary to keep our children safe. However, persistent anxiety and concern may be indicative of an anxiety disorder. If you have tried various stress-reduction measures (meditation, yoga, exercise) without results, it may be time to go to a professional for your mental illness.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. You Struggle To Function Everyday</h3><p id=\"\">Difficulty coping with day-to-day concerns is one of the most evident signs that you require mental health care. Self-sufficiency requires you to have the ability to deal with adversity. Conversely, certain mental health conditions hinder your ability to deal with daily difficulties. Depressed individuals, for instance, may find it difficult to function because they are exhausted and feel miserable, guilty, or hopeless. Those with anxiety may be unable to operate in society owing to strong feelings of dread or anxiety.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Incapacity to Stop Reliving a Traumatic Experience</h3><p id=\"\">You may develop mental health difficulties if you have just had a traumatic event and do not seek assistance. Trauma may profoundly affect one's mental health, therefore upending one's life. As a result, you may suffer traumatic flashbacks, recollections, depression, PTSD, and anxiety.</p><p id=\"\">When we see a distressing event, our brain generates stress hormones that may boost our blood sugar, heart rate, or adrenaline levels. This puts us on high alert and prepares our bodies to fight or flee. Some people's bodies return to normal rapidly. However, if the trauma is recurrent or prolonged, the brain may remain on high alert. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a treatable mental health illness that may be present if you cannot stop thinking about a horrific event.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Disconnection And Withdrawal From Others</h3><p id=\"\">Some individuals demand more solitude than others. In a healthy scenario, individuals use their alone time to recuperate, recharge and refocus before re-joining society. When such alone time results in further separation and isolation from family, friends, and once enjoyable activities, it may indicate a mental health issue. Isolation is frequently a symptom of mental health conditions requiring professional assistance, such as depression, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, and others.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. You Are Depressed, Miserable, And Apathetic</h3><p id=\"\">Everyone has their low times occasionally. Life may sometimes deal you a terrible hand. However, these blues can sometimes be an indicator of depression. When you think of a sad person, you see them as always tired and unpleasant. In truth, apathy is one of the most often reported symptoms of depression.</p><p id=\"\">Apathy is described as a profound lack of interest in oneself, one's life, and those around one, including persons and things that formerly excited one. It is the inability to comprehend why you cared for anything and the unwillingness to get out of bed in the morning. This common symptom of depression manifests in various ways, ranging from the usual low energy and hopelessness to difficulty concentrating and sleeping difficulties. It may emerge as poor cleanliness and strange eating habits since you cannot care.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Excessive or enigmatic Animosity or Anger</h3><p id=\"\">Irritability is a less-than-desirable sign of mental illness (especially depression) and one of the less-discussed symptoms. Anger and annoyance have been confined to dusty corners of psychology for quite some time. Beginning to be identified as indications of chronic depression by physicians.</p><p id=\"\">Everyone experiences anger and impatience sometimes. Some days do not go according to plan: Your coworkers are being unduly demanding, your children are ignoring you, and you run every red light and spill your coffee. It becomes problematic when anger manifests as excessive outbursts, significant chronic annoyance, or hatred against people who have done nothing to offend you.</p><p id=\"\">Repressed wrath and blatant hostility are detrimental not only to your relationships but also to your physical health. It can cause anxiety, compromise the immune system, and increase the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Significant Sleep and Appetite Alterations</h3><p id=\"\">Changes in our lives, such as relocating or beginning a new career, can disturb our sleeping and eating routines. However, when we become accustomed to the new condition, we revert to our previous practices. These fluctuations may indicate mental instability when they arise out of the blue. Excessive or insufficient sleep may suggest depression or worry. Fluctuations in weight or alterations in appetite may be indicators of depression or an eating disorder. Re-establishing positive habits may be facilitated by mental health therapy.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Addiction to Substances</h3><p id=\"\">Many persons with mental illness abuse alcohol or other substances to deal with their affliction. For instance, a person with bipolar symptoms may use alcohol to relax during a manic phase or utilize \"uppers\" to get them through a depressive phase. Sometimes, substance abuse can exacerbate the symptoms of a mental disorder or lead to further difficulties, such as addiction. Dual diagnosis therapy is available for individuals seeking treatment for drug abuse and mental illnesses.</p><p id=\"\">Please note that this is a partial list. Only an expert can determine if a treatment is appropriate for you. However, these signs may give you a general idea of what to search for.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">Let us be clear: there is nothing to be ashamed of if you seek mental health counseling. You are taking the necessary steps to live a fuller, healthier life, comparable to repairing a broken limb or taking insulin to treat diabetes.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">You might be surprised to learn that over 20% of the population struggles with mental illness. If a loved one or acquaintance has a mental health illness, they will most likely exhibit certain symptoms. Before delving into these warning signals, it is critical to understand that not everyone exhibits the same symptoms of a mental health problem. Furthermore, not all symptoms will be manifested to the same degree.</p><p id=\"\">People have been suffering from mental illnesses for thousands of years. Looking back in time, we can see that indicators of mental illness were evident long before we recognized or understood what they were. We've learned a lot about mental illness in recent years. As we understand more about mental illness and what it's like to suffer from it, we've discovered that millions of people suffer from various sorts and severity levels of mental health illnesses every day. Indeed, as we understand more about the various sorts of mental health issues, we are coming to grasp how widespread mental illness is and how manageable it is if properly detected and managed.</p><h2 id=\"\">5 Common Signs of Mental Illness</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Isolation from Family and Friends</h3><p id=\"\">People with mental illness are more prone to withdraw from family, friends, and loved ones when they experience symptoms. There are several causes for this. For instance, if your loved one does not understand why they are feeling low or 'off,' they may believe that others would not either. If the mental disease produces confusion, anxiety, or a low mood, they may begin to deal by isolating themselves or withdrawing. A withdrawing person will be less interested in activities they used to enjoy, may appear apprehensive or uncomfortable in social situations, and may even begin to avoid engaging or speaking with others around them.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Indications of Stress</h3><p id=\"\">A person with a mental illness will be stressed due to their internal changes and symptoms they are experiencing. The stress will increase over time, causing a variety of changes in the way the individual thinks, feels, and behaves. If you suspect a loved one has a mental illness, check for signs of stress in them. Among the indications are the following:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Taking a stance</li><li id=\"\">Irritability</li><li id=\"\">Fits of fury that are unexplained or excessive</li><li id=\"\">Being easily overburdened</li><li id=\"\">Crying fits</li><li id=\"\">Oversensitivity</li><li id=\"\">White deceptions</li><li id=\"\">Fatigue</li></ul><p id=\"\">It is also normal for someone just starting to deal with mental illness to display indications of discomfort when presented with settings that appear scary, different, or uncomfortable. This might be overwhelming for your loved one, so be mindful of symptoms of stress and approach that person softly and patiently.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Personality Change</h3><p id=\"\">A person with a mental illness will notice a change in personality and conduct. When an individual has a mental illness, they begin to view themselves and the environment differently and, as a result, begin to behave differently. Often, the shift will be slow and on the decline. Here are some instances of how behavior patterns and personalities may change:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">A shift in a social group</li><li id=\"\">Anxiety or anguish about doing routine duties, such as going to school or work; a lack of drive</li><li id=\"\">Finding new or odd things fascinating or amusing</li><li id=\"\">Inappropriate emotional expressions for the scenario</li><li id=\"\">Displaying more or less affection considerably</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">4. Deterioration in Functioning</h3><p id=\"\">A person with a mental illness may not know how badly they are impacted by what is happening within and around them. They may begin to forget things, fail to recognize strange behavior, or fail to be self-aware and focused on the current moment. Some symptoms that your loved one's functionality is deteriorating include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Graduation problems or other academic challenges</li><li id=\"\">Unfinished chores and obligations</li><li id=\"\">Consistent feelings of perplexity or apprehension</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">5. Loss Of Interest In Previously Intriguing Activities</h3><p id=\"\">Your loved one may exhibit indicators that indicate they are suffering from a type of mental disease causing some psychotic symptoms, depending on the type of symptoms and the degree of the mental health issue. Psychotic symptoms are those that arise when a person loses touch with reality. They are frequently severe and can cause major injury if adequate professional care is not sought. The following are some indicators that your loved one may be suffering from a serious mental health issue that causes psychotic symptoms:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Expressing lofty, strange, or unique beliefs</li><li id=\"\">Having paranoid or delusory thoughts</li><li id=\"\">Speaking to persons who do not appear to be present</li><li id=\"\">Speaking quietly or agitatedly to oneself or herself</li><li id=\"\">Claiming to be hearing voices or seeing persons that are not present</li><li id=\"\">Catatonia, or states of non-responsiveness</li><li id=\"\">They come from a family with a history of mental illness.</li></ul><p id=\"\">According to research, a considerable hereditary component adds to the chance of getting a mental health condition. People with a direct family member who suffers from a mental health condition (parent, grandparent, sibling, aunt, or uncle) are much more likely to suffer from that mental health disorder than those who do not.</p><p id=\"\">The National Institute of Health discovered that the beginning of mental health disorders has a major hereditary component. Recent research took a sample of 33,000 persons suffering from one of the five mental health problems to analyze its genetic influence:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Autism</li><li id=\"\">Attention Deficit Disorder Hyperactivity Disorder</li><li id=\"\">Bipolar illness</li><li id=\"\">Major Depressive Disorder</li><li id=\"\">Schizophrenia</li></ul><p id=\"\">According to the study's findings, each person in the sample who suffered from one or more mental health conditions had at least one of two distinct genes. This supports the notion that suffering from one or more mental health illnesses has a substantial genetic and hereditary component.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Bottom Line</h2><p id=\"\">Even though mental health issues can run in families, this does not imply that a person must have a family member with a mental health condition to suffer from one. Even those with no family history of mental disease can acquire a mental illness. This is because other factors such as environment, upbringing, socializing skills, capacity to cope with stress, physical health, and self-esteem all contribute to the emergence of mental health difficulties.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Everyone is different and faces different problems. But some basic parts of human psychology are almost always the same. Patients in psychotherapy often come in with different versions of the following questions, so it might be helpful to look at them from a bigger picture.</p><p id=\"\">Therapy is a great way to deal with many problems, such as anxiety, trouble sleeping, problems with relationships, and trauma. Research shows that it greatly helps people with mental health disorders, and experts think it's worth doing even if you don't have a physical problem.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Get Therapy?</h2><p id=\"\">Therapy can help with a lot of mental health problems. In therapy, people can learn how to deal with symptoms that may not respond to treatment immediately. Research shows that the effects of treatment last longer than the effects of medicine alone. Some symptoms of mental health problems can be helped by medication, but treatment teaches people how to deal with many of them on their own. These skills last after therapy, and the symptoms may improve if the therapist keeps touching the person.</p><h2 id=\"\">Reasons Why People Go to Therapy</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Isolation</h3><p id=\"\">We are by ourselves, and sometimes we feel alone and isolated. This can happen to us because of what we think. If we keep our ideas to ourselves and treat them as facts, they may seem \"crazy,\" isolated, or overwhelming. But if you can step back and realize that a thought is just an idea and not a fact, you can break out of this isolation. This is the beginning of cognitive restructuring, a key part of cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Self-Doubts</h3><p id=\"\">We all have the same ideas, feelings, and ways of acting. The only thing that makes us different is how we put those parts together. Everyone has doubts about who they are. Everyone has had the thought, \"Maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought I was,\" or \"Maybe I did a terrible job there.\"</p><p id=\"\">What's more, what do you know? Everyone makes errors. From time to time, you make a mistake. The difference is in how we think about these ideas and what we do to improve our happy thoughts and good moods. Do you lock yourself away after something terrible happens? Or do you try to find someone to talk to or do something you know will help you feel better?</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Having a mental illness or disorder</h3><p id=\"\">Psychotherapy is used to treat many common mental health problems. It is a very important way to help people who:</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Bipolar Illness</h3><p id=\"\">Bipolar illness Mood swings are one of the signs that something is wrong. You might be very happy and energetic, then feel sad and hopeless. You may also feel irritable and do things over and over again.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Eating Disorder</h3><p id=\"\">Women are more likely to get these illnesses, but men can also get them. One warning sign is that a person doesn't eat enough and gets dangerously thin. Another sign of an eating problem is binge eating and forcing yourself to throw up. Another red flag is if someone eats so much that they are overweight.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Drug Addiction</h3><p id=\"\">One of the warning signs is being unable to control how much alcohol or drugs you use. You might be unable to stop drinking even though it's making your life harder. Psychotherapy might help you get in charge of feelings, thoughts, or behaviors that make it hard for you to live your life. Counseling can last for a short time or for a long time. It can happen between two people or in a group setting. There may also be ways to relax, like meditation and lowering stress.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. PTSD</h3><p id=\"\">Warning signs show up after a stressful or dangerous event or time in your life. You might have scary flashbacks and bad dreams. You may need to avoid anything that makes you think about what happened.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Having Trouble with Changes In Life</h3><p id=\"\">Many things could make normal life seem hard. You might be dealing with a serious illness, problems in your relationships, the loss of your job, or the death or serious illness of a loved one, among other things. Psychotherapy can help you deal with things. It might help you make good decisions until your life returns to normal.</p><h2 id=\"\">Benefits of Seeking Therapy</h2><p id=\"\">If you're seeking help, you might think about the bad things that could happen. You might worry about how much it will cost. You may also know that counseling can be hard sometimes. It can be scary to talk about trauma or other hard things that happened in the past. Working through problems is hard, and treatment isn't always a quick fix. When you're ready to attend a therapist, be sure you can be honest with yourself and with them.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, therapy may pay off if you are willing to put in the work. Simply put, it's a place where you can feel comfortable opening up to a trained professional who is there to help you.</p><p id=\"\">Here are some good things about therapy:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. You'll Discover More About Yourself</h3><p id=\"\">Therapists will listen to what you say and help you see connections. If you are lost, they might tell you what to do or what to do next. You might feel more ready to act independently after going to therapy.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. You Can Reach Your Goals With The Help Of Therapy</h3><p id=\"\">If you don't know your goals, counseling can help figure out what they are and make a plan to reach them.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Therapy Could Help You Have Better Relationships With Other People. </h3><p id=\"\">Whether you're single or in a relationship, counseling may help you deal with relationship problems like feeling insecure or having trouble trusting your partners.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. You Have A Better Chance Of Being Healthy</h3><p id=\"\">Research shows that there is a link between mental and physical health. If you don't take care of mental health problems, they can affect your physical health. On the other hand, people who have good mental health may be better able to handle problems with their physical health.</p><p id=\"\">Therapy might help you get better in a lot of ways. If you think that something is stopping you from living the life you want, counseling can help. Therapy might help you figure out what's stopping you from making a change when you don't know what it is.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">Feelings are important for many reasons, including that they tell us something about ourselves. Our emotions lead us. If you are upset after being turned down for a job, it means you wanted the job or are worried about your career.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">The medical field is one in which practitioners strive to provide the best possible care for their patients. While this remains their primary focus, the reality is that they must also balance the demands of running a successful business simultaneously. These concerns, coupled with the growing demands of the behavioral healthcare industry, have made it more difficult than ever for organizations and practitioners to operate smoothly without digitizing their processes, especially financial ones.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we are aware of the need to have a comprehensive yet simple revenue cycle management solution, which is essential for making your facility run more efficiently and maximizing profitability. Our team of behavioral healthcare experts is dedicated to providing our clients with the exact resources they need to succeed in the industry.</p><h2 id=\"\">What is RCM?</h2><p id=\"\">The revenue cycle of a healthcare agency starts when a patient appointment is made and concludes when money is received for the services provided.</p><p id=\"\">Although it appears straightforward, there are essential procedures in between that, if improperly completed, might cause payments to be delayed. You risk losing the income that your facility relies on to survive if there are coding mistakes, information duplications, or incomplete information. The success of your business depends heavily on implementing effective revenue cycle management (RCM).</p><p id=\"\">RCM is a complex process of tracking and collecting payments for services rendered in the healthcare industry. It involves several activities, such as patient registration, billing, coding, and reimbursement and payment processing. In the behavioral healthcare sector, RCM software has become an invaluable tool for organizations to run successfully, as it streamlines processes, helps improve patient care, and increases the organization's overall financial health. </p><p id=\"\">The software provides a system for managing the financial components of a healthcare organization, from patient intake through billing. It does this by automating and streamlining the billing process, as well as keeping track of insurance claims and payments, ensuring that providers are paid for their services and that patients are correctly billed and reimbursed. </p><p id=\"\">Let’s look at some other benefits of using RCM software.</p><h3 id=\"\">Improved Revenue through Quicker Collections</h3><p id=\"\">Time-taking operations, including collecting information, insurance checking, and coding, will consume much less time when the proper software solutions and automation technologies are used. You may speed up the entire cycle by automating all of the cycle's processes, including eligibility verifications, payment confirmations, and data charge entries. Streamlining processes will increase the efficiency and success of your practice as you provide your staff and colleagues with a more straightforward process to follow, leading to faster payments and improved cash flow.</p><h3 id=\"\">Submitting High-Value Claims</h3><p id=\"\">Cautious office managers and medical professionals know that to ensure timely and accurate payments and maintain their bottom line, utilizing software for Revenue Cycle Management is the most efficient way to go. An RCM system allows them to guarantee their claims are filed to the fullest potential value before being submitted, mitigating the risk of reimbursements that fall between the cracks. Furthermore, this system requires less worker time, further boosting their profits.</p><h3 id=\"\">Reduced Denials.</h3><p id=\"\">Errors in the payment claim process lead to denials. With accurate revenue cycle management, there is minimal space for error in the system at your site. You may decrease claim denials and speed up payments by correctly coding the first time. Of course, configuring your RCM system with proactive denial notifications is the best method to prevent denials in the first place. Every employee in your medical practice will now be able to recode any flagged refused claims. An RCM's inability to identify inaccurate data reduces worker productivity and may obstruct the organization's ability to process payments.</p><h3 id=\"\">Reduced Time Wastage.</h3><p id=\"\">Your staff's responsibilities go well beyond merely billing and claims in many situations. The longer the billing process takes, the more time your doctors and medical staff will indeed spend dealing with billing issues. This is because overworked billing departments process bills more slowly. Initiating claims, following up when insurance companies need more information, and processing billing for each patient take longer when no specialized billing team exists. Additionally, it is more probable that claims from various departments may be handled at various times, adding to the workload and delaying the billing process. By using an RCM, doctors and non-billing personnel may spend more time concentrating on patient care rather than spending their time on billing. </p><p id=\"\">Additionally, it expedites the billing and claims process by assigning each case to a devoted, competent RCM staff member who can give it the attention required to follow through quickly, allowing your administration to concentrate on all of the other intricacies of their responsibilities.</p><h3 id=\"\">Better Patient Experience.</h3><p id=\"\">The patient experience may be impacted weeks or months following treatment when the stress of paying debts sets in. Using an RCM solution, you may simplify the billing procedure for patients and your personnel. This makes it simpler for patients to comprehend how their unique billing works. You'll receive payments from insurance companies and patients more quickly when there is less uncertainty, which also helps shorten payment delays. Additionally, a choice like the integrated healthcare software solution we provide here at Navix Hub makes it simple to send reminders to patients, increase patient involvement, and aid in more timely invoicing.</p><h3 id=\"\">Fixing RCM issues with Navix Health.</h3><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we understand that the billing process is not just about collecting money but rather about addressing the core issues which can lead to billing problems. Our team of experts has extensive experience with various RCM users and solutions, which enables us to assist behavioral healthcare organizations in resolving the most common challenges in the industry. Our revenue cycle management tools are designed to help behavioral healthcare organizations recover lost income, expedite accounts receivable processes, close out old payments, and improve collection efficiency. By leveraging our comprehensive revenue cycle management solutions, you can free up time to focus on the key components that are essential for the endurance and expansion of your business without having to fret about the tedious tasks associated with patient collections.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">For various reasons, most persons with major depressive disorder do not seek therapy. This may be because these individuals are uninformed of accessible therapy options. Individuals in their location may lack access to treatment, another possible cause. A third argument is that these individuals may receive little or no aid from their friends and family. Lastly, a fourth reason why persons with major depressive disorder do not seek treatment is that they are unaware that their symptoms are more than just transitory sorrow.</p><h2 id=\"\">Major Depressive Disorder</h2><p id=\"\">Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental diseases affecting persons. For some individuals, the condition may impede their ability to complete basic tasks and interfere with their everyday lives. When a person loses interest in something they formerly enjoyed for more than two weeks, this is a sign of serious depressive disorder. A person with severe depressive disorder is depressed for an extended period and displays at least four symptoms listed below.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Sleep difficulties</li><li id=\"\">Appetite loss and other eating difficulties</li><li id=\"\">Insufficient energy</li><li id=\"\">Concentration lapse</li><li id=\"\">Problems with self-esteem or confidence</li><li id=\"\">Suicidal or death-oriented thoughts</li></ul><p id=\"\">If you or someone you know exhibits four or more of these symptoms, you or they should consult a mental health professional.</p><h2 id=\"\">The Different Forms of Depression</h2><p id=\"\">Numerous people are unaware that there are numerous types of depression. There are two types of depression: dysthymia and major depressive disorder. Because there are numerous types of depression, a depressed individual should consult a medical professional to comprehend his symptoms better. A medical professional can help you choose an appropriate treatment. Here are some details regarding the numerous types of depression.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. I and II Bipolar Disorders</h3><p id=\"\">Bipolar disorder patients may experience mood swings ranging from hypomania or mania to severe depression. Because most hypomanic patients do not seek medical attention, trained health professionals may have difficulty distinguishing between bipolar and major depressive disorders. Frequently, affected individuals only seek therapy when they are depressed.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Cyclothymic Syndrome</h3><p id=\"\">Cyclothymic disorder is extremely similar to bipolar I and II disorders, albeit with milder highs and lows.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Persistent Depressive Illness</h3><p id=\"\">Persistent depressive disorder is a long-lasting form of depression typically milder than other types of depression. Nonetheless, this moderate sadness can develop into chronic depression if left untreated.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Syndrome of Premenstrual Dysphoria</h3><p id=\"\">Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is caused by hormonal fluctuations that occur three to seven days before a woman's menstrual period. Typically, depressive symptoms disappear after menstruation. It is essential to keep in mind that prescription medications, underlying medical conditions, and recreational drugs can all induce depression.</p><h2 id=\"\">What to Say to a Depressed Individual</h2><p id=\"\">Here are some things to say to someone who has a mental illness:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Inform Them Of Your Concern</h3><p id=\"\">These two simple words, \"I care,\" can mean a great deal to someone who believes the world is against them. A warm embrace or a gentle hand touch could also convey this message. The most important thing is to reach out and express your appreciation for the individual. </p><p id=\"\">Remember that while you may initially feel uneasy and uncertain, what you say does not need to be profound or lyrical. It should simply emanate from a place of acceptance and compassion.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Remind Them That You Are Readily Available</h3><p id=\"\">Depression may cause you to believe that no one understands or cares enough to attempt to comprehend what you're going through, which can be isolating and burdensome.</p><p id=\"\">According to research, people tend to withdraw when depressed, so reaching out to a friend in need is an essential first step. If your friend isn't ready to chat, continue encouraging them by spending time with them and frequently checking in via text, phone, or person.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Determine How You Can Be Of Assistance</h3><p id=\"\">You can probably do several things to aid your friend's recovery, as depression exerts a great deal of physical and mental strain on the individual experiencing it. Your friend may be hesitant to accept your offer out of fear of becoming a burden, so make it clear that you don't mind and are willing to help in the same way you know they would for you.</p><p id=\"\">It is also possible that your friend's melancholy has rendered them so exhausted and depressed that they do not know what kind of assistance to seek.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Encourage Them to Seek Advice from a Professional</h3><p id=\"\">Depression therapies are an essential component of recovery from depression, but many individuals are ashamed of their illness or skeptical that therapy can be effective.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Ask If They Wish To Speak</h3><p id=\"\">The most important thing you can do for a friend who is depressed is to listen compassionately as they express their pain, allowing them to release the weight of their suppressed emotions.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Listen Attentively </h3><p id=\"\">We all desire to assist those we care about, and we frequently propose quick solutions to alleviate our feelings of helplessness—people who are frequently depressed need to talk without having their conversation hijacked by well-meaning advice.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Reiterate Their Significance</h3><p id=\"\">Depressed individuals frequently believe that their lives are pointless and that no one would miss them if they were to die.</p><p id=\"\">If you sincerely express to your friend how much they mean to you and others, they will recognize their value and worth. When someone struggles with feelings of insignificance and melancholy, letting them know they are an essential part of your life can mean a great deal.</p><p id=\"\">In addition to informing your friend that they have a serious medical condition, you may reassure them that depression, like any other medical condition, is treatable. Your acquaintance has a very good chance of regaining normalcy with the aid of medication and therapy.</p><h2 id=\"\">Wrap Up</h2><p id=\"\">Being straightforward is frequently the easiest way to initiate a conversation. Determine if your friend is depressed. Avoid accusing, threatening, blaming, or diminishing your friend's emotions. Let them know you care and can discuss the matter with them if they choose.</p><p id=\"\">Show your support, look for ways to assist, and remind them that effective treatments are available. Keep an eye out for suicidal thoughts or actions and encourage them to seek treatment from a mental health professional.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Hard times come to us all, but the support of friends and family is what gets us through. We've also been concerned about other people's mental health. There are several methods to assist someone you care about, whether they are a friend, family member, or co-worker.</p><p id=\"\">It might be challenging to discuss your thoughts with friends or family. It's natural to be concerned about upsetting people you care about and to wonder what others will say or how it may damage your relationships.</p><p id=\"\">You may feel more comfortable confiding in friends or family than professionals, or you may find it simpler to start with a professional (such as your doctor). There is no right or wrong way to do things. However, those closest to us may frequently be useful sources of support.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Do People Go Through Mental Health Issues?</h2><p id=\"\">People deal with mental health concerns for a variety of reasons. Factors such as how much exercise you receive, drug and alcohol usage, the nature of your connections, your self-esteem, how lonely or isolated you feel, whether you're employed, heredity, and many more can all play a role.</p><p id=\"\">People who feel 'attached' to others and have more rewarding relationships are often happier. Of course, this does not mean that individuals with busy social lives or good relationships are not troubled, but those who feel more connected to others are frequently better equipped to deal with life's difficulties. Communication is essential in coping with mental health difficulties. People who freely discuss their mental health with friends, family, or a therapist are more likely to feel better about it.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Should We Start Talking About Mental Health?</h2><p id=\"\">The significance of discussing mental health cannot be overstated which is why it is important for individuals to understand the benefits of discussing mental health and urge them to do so openly.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Get Rid of the Stigma</h3><p id=\"\">By talking about mental illness more frequently, we as a culture can perhaps dispel the myths surrounding it. When these stereotypes are addressed, the stigma associated with mental health should be reduced.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Mental Health Disorders are on the Rise </h3><p id=\"\">Some mental health illnesses have become more common in recent decades. According to one study, Major Depressive Episodes in adolescents went from 11.93% to 12.63% in one year. 2 As more individuals are impacted by these concerns, it simply shows that you are not alone in your struggles, and discussing mental health should become more mainstream.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Encourage Treatment and Reduce Suicide Rates</h3><p id=\"\">This is possibly the most crucial reason we need to discuss mental health. Too many individuals are not getting the help they require because mental health is stigmatized. As a result, their poor mental health may lead to suicide. According to one study, more than 90% of those who commit suicide had indications of a mental health issue. </p><p id=\"\">An open conversation about mental health may help everyone heal. Most people don't understand that there are different methods for efficiently treating mental illness, and you may live a normal life by learning how to manage your mental health problem symptoms. Your mental health influences how you think, feel, and, eventually, act. It is critical that we share our feelings with people daily. More individuals may be motivated to seek expert care by openly discussing mental health.</p><h2 id=\"\">4 Ways to Improve Your Mental Health by Reaching Out</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Making Contact With Others</h3><p id=\"\">When dealing with mental health issues, many people feel lonely. It may even appear that others do not care or understand.</p><p id=\"\">If you reach out to someone, you may discover they have experienced similar experiences. You may treasure their support even more if you open up since they have been there.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Getting Rid Of the Secrets</h3><p id=\"\">For many people, having to pretend or suppress their emotions might exacerbate their suffering.</p><p id=\"\">On the other hand, friends, family, and those closest to you may turn out to be your most ardent advocates. Many feel better after talking about it since it is no longer a secret; they feel obligated to keep it to themselves.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Creating Stronger Ties</h3><p id=\"\">Reaching out can help someone truly comprehend what you're going through. You could even discover that the other person has had a similar experience, which could strengthen your bond.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Knowing How You Feel</h3><p id=\"\">One advantage of opening yourself to individuals close to you is that it allows them to know how you're feeling. This also implies that they will be better at assisting you in the future. For example, you could notice that they improve at seeing indications, listening, giving you space, and so on.</p><h2 id=\"\">Who Should You Talk To?</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Speak With Someone You Trust.</h3><p id=\"\">Talking to someone you trust about an uncomfortable situation will enable you to:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Sort out the issue.</li><li id=\"\">Examine the situation more closely.</li><li id=\"\">Consider the problem in a fresh or different light.</li><li id=\"\">Release accumulated stress: This helps you gain new insight into the scenario producing the issue.</li><li id=\"\">Discover that you are not alone; you may discover that many other individuals share your emotions.</li><li id=\"\">Find possibilities or solutions you had yet to consider previously.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Don't Keep Your Difficulties to Yourself</h2><p id=\"\">If you don't talk about your concerns, you can discover that your pent-up emotions or sentiments explode uncomfortably or inappropriately.</p><p id=\"\">You may also discover that things will worsen if you do not take immediate action.</p><h2 id=\"\">Other Methods for Dealing with Your Emotions</h2><p id=\"\">It is critical to discover ways to communicate your emotions. This helps you in releasing tension and making better judgments. You may express yourself in a variety of ways, including:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Do activities that make you happy, like reading or exercising.</h3><p id=\"\">Write about how you feel if you want to examine your emotions. Some people keep diaries or notebooks, while others jot down whatever comes to mind. You may write a tale about whatever is upsetting you.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Avoid circumstances that may stress you out or make you upset.</h3><p id=\"\">Self-talk entails intentionally changing negative thought patterns to help you see things more positively.</p><p id=\"\">Meditation is one method for focusing your thoughts and considering the broader picture. Is your unpleasant circumstance worth stressing over? Will it make a difference in the long run? Play a sport or engage in some physical activity - it will give you several opportunities to expend pent-up energy.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Draw, paint, or construct a collage to express yourself.</h3><p id=\"\">Singing, playing, or listening to music (or even screaming) may all be beneficial. Dance at home to music, or dance as much as you like.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">When discussing mental health, nothing is humiliating or ashamed. You may help people understand depression, anxiety, stress, and other issues by reaching out to others around you. Opening out can help them recognize that they are not alone in their struggles. Not only will this help remove the stigma associated with mental health, but it may also give those struggling the courage to open out – and feel a lot better for it.</p><p id=\"\">You could be dealing with a situational issue that will improve with time to process or changes to your environment (such as switching lockers to get away from a bully), or you could be dealing with a more long-term mental health issue. Mental health problems are widespread and curable; however, you may need to try a few different approaches to discover your best treatment or a mix of tactics.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

A lot of young people also have trouble with the following:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">There is too much pressure to do well in school or get into well-known colleges and universities.</li><li id=\"\">The pressure to do well in sports, the arts, or other activities outside of school.</li><li id=\"\">Tight schedules that don't leave enough time for rest, relaxation, and free play</li><li id=\"\">Bullying (in person, on social media, or both) .People still worry about climate change, global conflict, and other big problems.</li><li id=\"\">Discrimination based on a person's race, gender, sexual orientation, weight, religion, disability, or other factors</li><li id=\"\">Poverty or insufficient money for a safe, stable living place and healthy meals.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">How Will I Know If My Teenager Needs Help?</h2><p id=\"\">Your child's mental health signs will, of course, be unique to them. But as a parent or caretaker, you have a good idea of what is \"normal\" for them.</p><p id=\"\">Besides more obvious signs like mood swings, impatience, anger, and tears, you may also notice:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Changes in sleep, weight, eating habits, or other daily habits that are big enough to be noticed</li><li id=\"\">Getting less interested in things they used to like or stop doing things they used to like</li><li id=\"\">Pulling away more than usual from friends, family, and the community</li><li id=\"\">Making plans with their closest friends and then canceling them for little or no reason</li><li id=\"\">Academic problems can look different or more serious, like when students fail quizzes in their favorite subject or refuse to do assignments that seemed easy before.</li><li id=\"\">Constant worries or thoughts that won't go away</li><li id=\"\">A brand-new set of friends you've never met before</li></ul><p id=\"\">They won't tell you what's bothering them, even when you've made it as safe as possible for them to do so. Obsession with a certain goal, maybe because they think that their life will be ruined if they don't reach it.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Changes in Sleeping Habits</h3><p id=\"\">Your teen may say they can't sleep or start napping after school. A mental health problem in a teen could also make them want to stay in bed all day or stay up all night.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Loss Of Interest In Everyday Things</h3><p id=\"\">If your teen stops doing things they used to enjoy or doesn't want to hang out with other people, they may have a mental disorder.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Significant Changes In Academic Performance</h3><p id=\"\">Concerns about mental health can make it much harder to stay motivated to do schoolwork. If your child has lost interest in schoolwork or is falling behind, this could be a sign of a mental health problem.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Changes In Appetite Or Weight</h3><p id=\"\">If your child have an eating problem, they might skip meals, hoard food, or change weight quickly. Weight changes are a common sign of depression. </p><h3 id=\"\">5. Very Short Temper</h3><p id=\"\">Teens with mental illness might get angry too much, cry for no reason, or be irritable.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Isolation</h3><p id=\"\"> A strong desire to be alone or hide too much could also indicate a mental health disorder.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Signs Of Using Drugs, Alcohol, Or Other Substances</h3><p id=\"\">Cuts, burns, bruises, and other signs of self-harm that your child tries to hide or can't give a full and honest explanation for</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Sexual Activity Or Desire That Seems New Or Stronger Than It Was Before</h3><p id=\"\">Remember that your child may not be in crisis just because they have one of these signs. Changes in hormones, which all tweens and teens go through, can affect your child's mood, academic performance, and other things. However, you must talk to your kid about their mental health if you detect one or more of these indications frequently.</p><h2 id=\"\">Treatment Options for Teens Mental Illness</h2><p id=\"\">If your doctor thinks your teen needs more testing, they may refer your teen to a mental health expert. A mental health expert, like a psychologist or licensed clinical social worker, may talk to you and your teen to find out more.</p><p id=\"\">Some people who work in mental health care give out written questionnaires or other screening tools. Others may also get information from the person who cares for their teen's health.</p><p id=\"\">If you need it, a professional in mental health can give you the right diagnosis. They may also advise you on the best ways to treat your teen's mental health, such as talk therapy or medicine.</p><h2 id=\"\">Get Your Child Some Help</h2><p id=\"\">Everyone in the family is affected by a teen's mental health. If your child has a mental illness, you need to get help for yourself right away.</p><p id=\"\">Keeping your mind strong might be easier if you talk with other parents. Some parents feel better when they talk to other parents who get them. Some people find it helpful to learn about services and educational opportunities in their area.</p><p id=\"\">Find a local support group or talk to the doctor who takes care of your teen to find out about services in your area. It is also helpful to look for online groups or forums that can help, support, or point you in the right direction.</p><p id=\"\">You might even consider going to a therapist without your teenager. If you want to be the best parent for your child but you're feeling overwhelmed by parental stress, talking to a mental health expert can help.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Finding a reputable therapist that you get along with is crucial. You could talk about sensitive topics or tell them something you've never told anyone else. So you want to interact with someone who is open to your ideas and listens to you. But there are so many options and ways to find a therapist that it can be hard to choose one.</p><p id=\"\">This article talks about a few ways to limit or broaden your choices and find a therapist who is likely to work well for you.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Your Therapist Should Know?</h2><p id=\"\">A therapist is not just a friend who listens to your problems and gives advice. Instead, the best therapist will help you see and change harmful ways of thinking and acting while accepting you for who you are. &nbsp;A good therapist helps you get better without making you feel bad about your problems.</p><p id=\"\">You will get the most out of your treatment time if you are careful about what you choose. It is important to choose a therapist with good credentials and good people skills that help build trust and lead to positive growth.</p><h2 id=\"\">When Is A Good Idea To See A Therapist?</h2><p id=\"\">If you don't know your next step, or what to do, or if you're confused and overwhelmed by how you feel, you might want to try counseling. Therapy is for anyone who wants to get out of or through a hard situation or any mental illness and is willing to work at it. People often think of therapy when in a panic, but you don't have to be at your lowest point to benefit from it. Talking to a therapist can be very helpful if you are dealing with depression, anxiety, relationship problems, family problems, couple problems, mood and stress problems, or any other kind of change in your life.</p><p id=\"\">Some signs that it's time to see a therapist are:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Confusion</li><li id=\"\">Not knowing who you are</li><li id=\"\">Dislike for certain people, places, or situations</li><li id=\"\">Changes in how and when you eat and sleep</li><li id=\"\">Feeling overburdened</li><li id=\"\">Agitated gloomy mood irritable mood</li><li id=\"\">Having a lot to do</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Things to Remember When Looking For In a Therapist</h2><h3 id=\"\">1. Choose The Type Of Therapy</h3><p id=\"\">To find a good therapist, you must first decide what kind of treatment you want. You and your therapist can do different kinds of therapy together. Choose the one that fits your goals. Some therapists are good at giving many different kinds of.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Determine Your Budget</h3><p id=\"\">Therapy could cost a lot of money, depending on where you get it. Some kinds of care are given for free. Counseling may be less expensive if you do it online. Some therapists might charge more than others. </p><p id=\"\">Find out what your insurance covers and how much you're willing to pay monthly for treatment before making appointments with individual therapists. You can prioritize therapists in your price range if you know this number.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Referrals Are Useful For Finding A Therapist</h3><p id=\"\">If you feel comfortable, ask your family and friends for suggestions. Your friends and family may be able to tell you more about a good therapist than what you can find online. Even if a therapist has worked with someone you care about, they might not be your best choice. Still, your specific needs and goals for therapy will determine the best therapist for you.</p><p id=\"\">Some of the people or groups in your network may also have good ideas like:</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Your Institution</h3><p id=\"\">If you go to a college or university, the student health or psychology department is likely well-connected with a network of experienced therapists.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Your Insurance Provider</h3><p id=\"\">Your insurance company will have a list of psychotherapists whose services they cover and their relationships with them.</p><p id=\"\">Other jobs you know something about. Even if they don't work in health care, these people could help you in your search. Consider asking doctors, lawyers, and other professionals you know and trust for a referral from their professional network.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Where You Go To Pray </h3><p id=\"\">If you are part of a religious group, other members may be able to help.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Examine Credentials</h3><p id=\"\">When looking for a therapist, it's important to look at their credentials to ensure they're qualified. The APA says that a potential therapist should be licensed to work in the state or area where they live. Therapists may also be certified in a certain type of therapy, such as exposure therapy.</p><p id=\"\">But remember that a therapist's title may not matter as long as they are qualified to help you in the way you want. Some people who can help you are counselors, social workers, psychologists, or psychotherapists.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Figure Out What You Want To Get Out Of Therapy</h3><p id=\"\">Getting the right therapist might be easier if you know what you want from therapy. If you want to find a treatment for a specific problem, this may help you narrow down your choices. Here are some things to think about:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Dealing with the stress, trauma, phobias, and sadness caused by what you went through in your relationships</li><li id=\"\">A mental health problem you know you have or think you might have, an emotional problem you need help with</li></ul><p id=\"\">Once you know what you want to get out of treatment, tell the therapist right away. Keep in mind that some problems, like relationships and stress, might not need the help of a therapist, while others, like depression, might. Even if you don't know what to talk about, it's fine to talk to someone. A good therapist will help you set goals and work toward them as you go through treatment.</p><p id=\"\">Over time, they'll help you gain the skills and confidence to handle emotional problems independently.</p><h3 id=\"\">9. Think About Getting Help Online</h3><p id=\"\">Online counseling may be a useful and easy-to-find resource for many people. Online counseling could be very helpful if you don't have access to a therapist in your area. You can talk to a counselor online through several apps. Even if you do online therapy, it's important to find a trained professional who fits your needs. Choose an app that only puts you in touch with licensed therapists.</p><p id=\"\">Some online therapy programs make it easy to stop working with a therapist you don't like and quickly connect you with a new one. This is a big benefit because it lets you test out as many people as you need to quickly and easily find the right fit.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">Finding the right therapist for you may take some time, but the work is well worth it. Some therapists might not be a good fit for your needs. Even though these things may make you feel down, don't give up.</p><p id=\"\">Getting therapy is a good way to improve your mental health. Finding the right therapist will help you for the rest of your life in ways you can't even imagine.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "blog-content": "As a mental health organization, you put a lot of effort into improving your customers' lives. Your work enables people to overcome obstacles and develop into their best selves.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">As a mental health organization, you put a lot of effort into improving your customers' lives. Your work enables people to overcome obstacles and develop into their best selves. Your staff and patients do not deserve to be slowed down by problematic software and outdated systems for classifying cases, composing case notes, and maintaining communication. This is especially crucial for nonprofit behavioral health organizations, which frequently operate on razor-thin budgets, doing as much as they can with their limited resources.</p><p id=\"\">In the current healthcare climate, a focus on employee well-being and mental health is more important than ever. Hospitals and clinics are turning to cutting-edge technological solutions, like electronic medical records (EMRs), customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and revenue cycle management (RCM) platforms, to help with this goal. While these systems have traditionally been used to improve communication and streamline data management between providers, patients, and staff, they can also play a key role in promoting employee well-being.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">When your mental health organization doesn’t fit neatly into a box like other organizations, why should you expect your behavioral health software to do the same? By integrating CRM, RCM, and EMR processes, Navix Health helps you improve your customer relationships, finances, and record-keeping operations according to what suits you and your team the best. This way, you can reduce workplace tension and consequently improve your workforce's mental health as more work gets down with less effort.</p><p id=\"\">Here’s a closer look at how an EMR, CRM, and RCM integrated system can help with employee well-being and mental health in healthcare settings.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Effective management improves mental wellness in the workforce.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Poor mental health not only has a significant effect on the employees but also has adverse effects on companies, including higher staff turnover, sick leave, lower motivation, and lost productivity.</p><p id=\"\">Substantial evidence supports the idea that workplaces with high mental wellness levels are more productive. In fact, taking care of employee welfare at work can boost output by up to <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/publications/how-support-mental-health-work#:~:text=Good%20mental%20health%20at%20work,by%20as%20much%20as%2012%25.\" id=\"\">12%</a>. Employers must have policies and procedures in place to monitor employee mental health at work and be prepared to provide assistance if necessary.</p><p id=\"\">Healthcare organizations must keep an eye on and provide more significant mental health assistance for their employees. Frequently, spending extra time off unwell is the first indication that someone has poor mental health. Absence patterns, such as consistently taking certain days off or spending more time off than usual, may point to an issue.</p><p id=\"\">However, the behavioral healthcare industry is one of the world's most demanding and rapidly expanding industries. Employers already have much on their plate to deal with, so a software system that allows them to track absences and spot trends in employee behavior can be highly beneficial. Managers may find out the real reasons why the individuals the system alerts are taking time off by communicating with them. This way, they can ensure appropriate re-engagement and support are in place when they return to work. Employers can ensure their staff is mentally healthy by keeping an eye on absences and setting up frequent catch-ups with workers.</p><h3 id=\"\">How workforce management technology supports mental health at work</h3><p id=\"\">Workforce management software, particularly solutions designed to enable better workforce engagement, helps organizations strengthen employee relationships and better support employee well-being. Particularly now, when businesses are trying to recover after multiple lockdowns, workforce management software is a tool that organizations are turning to provide support and motivation to team members worrying about their jobs. Using self-service portals gives employees more control over their work experience. Also, it enables management to use the technology to check how their team members feel physically and mentally.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Achieving work-life balance</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In order to ensure good mental well-being, striking the right work-life balance is critical as it helps one de-stress and take a break from the pressures that come with working in the behavioral health sector. Navix Health's integrated CMR, EMR, and RCM system allow the workforce to streamline the organization's processes and have easier access to communication and record-keeping tools, which enables them to free up their time and relieve themselves from an abundance of management tasks. The environment at a healthcare organization is a stressful one, and a good software system in place can make it much better for the workforce, increasing overall productivity as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Swift information access for first responders.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The job of first responders is an extremely stressful one; they have to perform as quickly as possible to provide patients with the proper treatment. Time is vital in such instances. Recent incidents have brought to light the need for emergency medical providers to have access to patient data. With an integrated software system, first responders can access patient medical records in an instant, allowing first responders to quickly and accurately assess their patients and provide more tailored care, thus relieving some of the pressure from their shoulders.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Swift information access for the workforce.&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">With separate systems of adding and retrieving information, workforce members may have to log in and log out of different platforms to get all the data they are looking for. Automating processes and integrating CRM, EMR, and RCM systems enable employees to engage with just one platform rather than login and log out of multiple programs. For example, having a workforce management solution that integrates with revenue cycles and customer management gives employees much greater control. The ability to update and access patient information immediately, rather than waiting for someone else to do it or switching between several systems themselves, plays a significant role in promoting good mental health. Practical technological solutions that assist employees in managing their activities are vital in managing work, life, and welfare in these times of uncertainty and unpredictability.</p><p id=\"\">Overall, Navix Health’s integrated EMR, RCM, and CRM software can positively impact employee well-being by reducing the amount of time and effort spent on administrative tasks and allowing healthcare providers and their workforce to focus more on their well-being and patient care.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

It's one of the most important strategies your business can focus on, and it matters during every stage of growth.</p><p id=\"\">Digital marketing strategies constantly evolve, and it's imperative that you stay up to date on the latest trends. At Navix Health, we offer cutting-edge solutions and comprehensive support to help <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/facilities\" id=\"\">facility leaders</a> manage the evolving logistical needs of behavioral healthcare.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">&nbsp;Here are some of the main mistakes all CEOs, owners, and marketing representatives need to be aware of as we move into the new year.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Deceptive Marketing Practices&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=\"\">It's no secret that many treatment centers rely on inaccurate and fraudulent marketing campaigns to secure lead generation. For-profit treatment has opened a chasm for greed and has created what Assistant State Attorney Alan Johnson cited as the Wild West where \"<em id=\"\">the good providers were being driven out of business by these rogue bad actors.\"</em></p><p id=\"\">Not only is deceptive marketing unethical and ineffective, but it's life-threatening. Overselling a service that your company doesn't render preys on some of the most vulnerable people and their families seeking assistance.</p><p id=\"\">In all cases, clients seeking treatment undoubtedly deserve to know the full truth about what your company can provide for them. That means all digital marketing efforts must accurately showcase what your program genuinely entails.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Weak Search Engine Optimization Efforts</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Unless your team truly knows how to engage in advanced keyword research and track an ad campaign, you'll probably need to work with a professional SEO agency. Unfortunately, this can be its own tenuous task, as many agencies oversell their services and make grandiose claims that they can't achieve.</p><p id=\"\">If you want to outsource your SEO strategy, here's what you need to ask before hiring any contractor or company:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">What kind of SEO strategy does your organization specialize in (i.e. technical SEO, UX, off-page, creating content)?</li><li id=\"\">Which specific metrics do you use to track campaign success?</li><li id=\"\">What turnaround time can I reasonably expect to see results?</li><li id=\"\">What's your specific strategy for engaging in keyword and market research?</li><li id=\"\">What's your approach to building a social media presence?</li><li id=\"\">What particular SEO tools do you use and why do you use those ones?</li><li id=\"\">How will we collaborate to create quality content and work in tandem?</li></ul><p id=\"\">One mistake that many treatment centers make is to simply <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make\" id=\"\">hand off their marketing plan</a> to a third-party company. While this may be feasible after several months of working together, you want someone who can closely review the work at first. This ensures that content creation accurately reflects the business and that your SEO strategy is securing relevant leads.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Overlooking Mobile Optimization</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Research shows that mobile browsing accounts for nearly<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/#:~:text=Mobile%20accounts%20for%20approximately%20half,since%20the%20beginning%20of%202017.\" id=\"\"> 50% of all web traffic</a> worldwide. Mobile optimization is non-negotiable, and failing to prioritize may inadvertently alienate your target audience.</p><p id=\"\">Your website needs to be as aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use on a smartphone or tablet as it is on a desktop. Research shows that users generally expect a site to load within about 1-2 seconds, and more than half of all mobile site visits are abandoned if a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Spreading Marketing Campaigns Too Thin</strong></h2><p id=\"\">There's a lot of pressure to have an active and large following on numerous social media platforms, maintain a robust and informative blog, attend in-person networking events, and create dynamic videos- all at the same time. Unless you have an unlimited budget, your digital marketing strategy may need more refining.</p><p id=\"\">Most marketing experts agree that it's far more valuable to deeply focus their efforts on 1-2 platforms/marketing channels rather than take a more scattered approach.</p><p id=\"\">Over time and with proven results, your treatment center can expand its reach. But at first, you want to ensure that search engines are picking up on the highest-quality marketing your company can offer. It's better to have less exposure that's far more comprehensive and accurate than to waste your time, money, and resources on haphazard advertising.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Relying Too Much (Or Too Little) On Word-Of-Mouth Advertising</strong></h2><p id=\"\">While word-of-mouth advertising certainly has its merit (and undoubtedly saves costs), treatment centers need to be aware of its inherent limitations.</p><p id=\"\">Depending too much on word-of-mouth referrals constricts your facility's visibility to a fairly narrow population. This strategy will generally overlook <em id=\"\">many </em>potential clients who might benefit from your company's service. In addition, when you heavily rely on word-of-mouth leads, you may be more susceptible to the pitfalls of negative feedback.</p><p id=\"\">At the same time, your professional, in-person reputation matters. People talk- they will absolutely share their failures and success stories, and they will have no problem turning to the Internet to review your organization.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Incongruent Admissions Process</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Just as marketing campaigns need to be accurate, your admissions team needs to be acutely aware of what is and isn't being advertised about your company. One of the biggest marketing fails is a potential client or family member referencing something about your business without your team being aware of what that service is.</p><p id=\"\">Staff should be aware of what comes up in local search results and on social media. In other words, make sure you're in front of what your website visitors will see. If you're not, you risk losing a hold of your overall marketing strategy.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Focusing Too Much On Your Brand</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most people recognize the importance of company branding, which refers to having a distinctive design, message, and tone. All businesses need a strong brand- it's what helps them stay consistent with everything they do (both online and in-person).</p><p id=\"\">At the same time, people seeking treatment need to know that you truly understand their needs. They care about your team's background and expertise, but the overarching concern they have is: <em id=\"\">Can you actually help me? Do you understand what I'm dealing with? Are you fit to provide me with support?</em></p><p id=\"\">While some of this comes down to branding, your company must strike a balance of focusing on what the reader needs (rather than littering your brand throughout the page). This can, in so many ways, come across as desperate and gimmicky.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Streamlining Your Admissions and Operations With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we work closely with large-scale mental health and addiction treatment facilities.

        "blog-content": "Psychological studies show that self-love and self-compassion are important for mental health and well-being and keep people from being sad or anxious.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Self-love may make some people think of hippies who hug trees or of cheesy how-to manuals. On the other hand, several psychological studies show that self-love and self-compassion are important for mental health and well-being and keep people from being sad or anxious. In the blog that, we'll look at some of the things you can do to develop self-love.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Self-Love Affects Your Mental Health</h2><p id=\"\">Everyone talks about self-love, in books, songs, and quotes. But what is it, exactly? Self-love seems like a luxury to a lot of people instead of a need. One of the reasons why most people find it hard to love themselves is that they have become so used to the idea of \"perfection\" that they have forgotten how valuable they are. As social media and filtered reality become more popular, it's getting harder for people to believe in themselves. What they don't realise is that by giving up on themselves, they make stress, worry, and depression more likely to happen to them. Here are a few of the many reasons why loving yourself is important for your mental health.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. To Avoid Making Comparisons</h3><p id=\"\">Have you ever stopped to think about why you compare yourself to other people? When you don't love yourself, you automatically compare yourself to others, which is bad for your mental health. You need to keep in mind that everyone has special qualities that no one else has. Find yours, and your mental health will get better. It's time to stop making useless comparisons that hurt your self-esteem and lead you down a dark path of worry. And once you start to love yourself, you'll be able to love others without restrictions.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Getting More Confident</h3><p id=\"\">If you didn't already know, how you feel about yourself has a big effect on your mental health. When you don't believe in yourself, you start to question your passions, goals, and wants. Yes, it is hard to accept yourself with all of your flaws, but it is not impossible. Start small and make each step count. The road may be long, but it will be worth it. If you have faith, you won't question every choice you make and will be able to move on to a better future. Take a step toward self-love now if you want to make yourself happier and give your mind some peace.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. You're Aware of Your Mistakes</h3><p id=\"\">Don't be so hard on yourself when you make a mistake or fail. It's part of life. When you love yourself, you become more aware of your options and possibilities. When you accept your mistakes, you become kinder, more able to forgive, and more ready to move on. You start looking for answers instead of dwelling on your problems. You not only learn to accept your flaws, but you also become less afraid of repeating them and more sure of yourself when you do. Stop yelling at yourself every time you mess up or fail.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. To Keep Relationships Healthy</h3><p id=\"\">Remember that we teach people how to treat us. People treat someone badly when they don't have self-love or self-respect. It is very important when it comes to relationships. If you love yourself, you set a standard for how you should be treated in a relationship, whether it's with friends, family, or a romantic partner. So, if you want other people to love and respect you, you have to love and respect yourself first.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. To Improve Health </h3><p id=\"\">When you care about yourself, it's because you love yourself. A small waist or abs are just signs of a healthy body. A person who takes care of their mental and physical health is healthy. You need to start putting yourself first. You are the only one who can take responsibility for improving your mental health, which is just as vital as your physical health. You are the only person who can work toward improving your mental health, which is just as crucial as your physical health.</p><h2 id=\"\">Why Is It Important To Love Yourself?</h2><p id=\"\">When you're in touch with your beliefs, it's easier to live a life that's really you. Self-love gives us the strength to be assertive, make decisions, and set limits in our lives. Here are some of the benefits of having self-love:</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Boosts Self -Esteem</h3><p id=\"\">Self-love is important for good mental health and is linked to self-esteem. Self-esteem is how you feel about yourself in general. It depends on how much you like or care about all the little things that make you unique. We can all look at ourselves with a critical eye from time to time. But if you don't like yourself, it can make you feel bad and hurt your mental health.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. You Worry Less</h3><p id=\"\">When we feel good about ourselves, we are less likely to worry. Researchers have found that a healthy sense of self-worth may protect against worry. This is because when we feel good about ourselves, our bodies tend to release less of the stress hormone cortisol.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Develop Your Resilience</h3><p id=\"\">If you love yourself, it's easier to get over hard times. Research shows that rejection and failure leave less of an emotional mark on us when we have a higher sense of self-worth.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Control over Life</h3><p id=\"\">Psychologists say that practicing self-love, especially when things are hard, could give you a stronger \"internal locus of control.\" This means that you have more control over your life and start to feel safer.</p><p id=\"\">Improve how you talk to other people. How you treat yourself sets the tone for every other relationship you have because the only way to connect with other people is to connect deeply with yourself.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">Putting yourself first and adhering to these tips are great ways to boost your mental health and overall well-being. If you want to keep your mental health in check, you should seek counselling.</p><p id=\"\">Whether you're single or in a relationship, you'll only ever have a relationship with yourself for the rest of your life. Since you'll spend the rest of your life with yourself, it's important to learn to love yourself. So, be kind to yourself now and every day, and show yourself care, compassion, and love.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">We’re just at the cusp of some of the most fascinating and cutting-edge times in technology. The rise of <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-dawn-of-a-new-era-how-ai-is-revolutionizing-behavioral-health\" id=\"\">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and machine learning (MI) have fundamentally impacted nearly every industry, and continued advancements will continue to accelerate worldwide invocation.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With that, there is an undeniable intersection between technology and behavioral healthcare management. So, what will the future hold, and how will this affect current clinicians and their practices? Let’s get into what you need to know.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Artificial Intelligence Vs. Machine Learning: Similarities and Differences</h2><p id=\"\">AI is a broad umbrella term that refers to how machines and computers engage in tasks that once required human intelligence. It’s no secret that AI has changed the landscape of nearly every modern field, and it’s likely that continued advances will continue evolving how companies operate.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Machine learning (ML) is a specific type of AI that refers to how algorithms or statistical models shape how computers make decisions. ML can support performance without explicit programming, and this is done via either supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced learning. ML is responsible for trends like facial recognition, predictive text, and speech recognition.</p><p id=\"\">ML is a significant component of many AI applications, and it’s still in its infancy stages. When done correctly, it allows companies to make accurate predictions and choices based on summarized data. For this reason alone, it’s become an essential part of AI systems.</p><h2 id=\"\">Artificial Intelligence in Behavioral Health Management</h2><p id=\"\">AI has dramatically changed <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-complete-guide-to-facility-management-software-in-behavioral-health-how-navix-health-enhances-operations\" id=\"\">behavioral health management</a>, and those changes have coincided with some fear and criticism. While these responses are valid (nobody likes the potential threat of a robot doing their job!), it’s equally important to consider the many benefits of AI. AI tools can augment healthcare professionals’ practices and support multifaceted processes, including assessment, diagnosis, and intervention planning.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Customized treatment planning: </strong>Comprehensive treatment planning is the heart of effective healthcare. With that, AI can help clinicians create individualized plans that consider a client’s full scope of emotional needs, presenting issues, and medical history into account. The algorithms can also review historical client information to provide recommendations on treatment strategies. In-network clinicians may note that using AI can help them develop <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\">effective notes</a> and treatment plans that adhere to each insurance provider’s requirements.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Advanced data analytics: </strong>AI can analyze significant databases to assess behavioral health trends. These tools can provide fast, efficient results, and such findings can help providers make informed decisions about their own interventions. Such strategizing may be particularly useful for newer companies or management teams looking to set policies in place.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increased accessibility: </strong>It’s no secret that there’s a shortage of effective mental health providers, and we have seen this shortage truly come to light since the COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread, <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/how-can-virtual-care-close-health-care-disparities\" id=\"\">mainstream use of virtual support</a> has improved accessibility to treatment services for clients of all demographics.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Medication management: </strong>Medication adherence is also an essential part of treatment. AI can help with all features of this process, including sending clients automatic medication reminders, tracking compliance, and alerting providers if people deviate from their prescriptions.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">Machine Learning in Behavioral Health Management&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">Machine learning supports behavioral health management by increasing the accuracy and execution of services. Here are some ways providers are taking advantage of this technology:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Earlier detection: </strong>ML algorithms can screen and analyze complete patient histories via their EHRs, self-reports, and old assessments. This information can then be used to predict potential diagnoses.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Predictive modeling: </strong>Predictive modeling refers to sourcing known genetics and environmental variables to present potential mental health risk factors. A prediction is not a guarantee, but it can offer a roadmap for clinicians and clients alike.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Natural language processing: </strong>Natural language processing (NLP) refers to how machines can interpret various text or speech patterns to increase awareness of one’s mental health.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Personalized technology: </strong>Many app companies are using ML to create customized mental health apps that tailor their content based on a user’s progress or relevant needs.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Crisis intervention: </strong>Virtual assistants and chatbots created by ML technology can be instructed to provide <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\">immediate crisis intervention</a> to high-risk individuals. This does not replace clinicians, but it can add supplemental support when time is of the essence.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Individualized interventions: </strong>ML can support mental health providers to conceptualize the best interventions for their treatment. These interventions may be predicted by data-driven insight, where the ML gleans information from various patterns and presented risk factors.</p><h2 id=\"\">Getting Started at Navix Health&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we pride ourselves on being industry pioneers in applying our one-of-a-kind <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/navix-ai\" id=\"\">Navix AI </a>to mental health.

With that, they also may not be adhering to the best practices when<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\"> writing clinical notes</a>.</p><p id=\"\">It's important for all healthcare professionals to streamline their paperwork processes. In doing so, you free up your capacity to focus on patient care, and you can also achieve a better work-life balance where you don't inherently have to bring paperwork home with you.</p><p id=\"\">In this article, we'll explore the best strategies on how to write medical notes faster, and we'll discuss exactly what your medical documentation needs to include.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Guidelines for Optimal Clinical Records</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Patient notes should accurately indicate each individual's treatment plan, goals, and progress toward achieving those goals. When writing progress notes, you want to consider that these forms can be audited and viewed at any time- whether that's by the patient, their insurance company, or in legal proceedings. With that, it's imperative to write each patient note objectively and neutrally.</p><p id=\"\">Every note needs to include the following information:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">The individual's name</li><li id=\"\">The session date and time</li><li id=\"\">Chief complaint</li><li id=\"\">Any significant changes in appearance, mood, or symptoms</li><li id=\"\">Changes in the medical record</li><li id=\"\">Patient's status regarding emotions and presenting issues</li><li id=\"\">Relevant information about medical details</li><li id=\"\">Treatment goals</li><li id=\"\">Interventions used</li><li id=\"\">Clinician observations</li><li id=\"\">Plan for the next appointment</li><li id=\"\">Name and signature</li></ul><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Use Appropriate Clinical Terms</strong></h3><p id=\"\">When in doubt, use the right clinical terms for each note, and ensure that you keep continuity over time. It's generally discouraged to use slang in your documentation, and that's because slang isn't always universally understood. In addition, try to steer clear of using ambiguous terms that don't accurately describe the content of your client's story.</p><p id=\"\">It's best to adhere to standardized clinical terminology. Use clear, transparent language that accurately reflects your patient's condition, overall progress in treatment, and when the next therapy session will take place.</p><p id=\"\">If you're unsure where to begin, consider referring to an established training protocol that focuses on the main terms used by healthcare professionals. This<a href=\"https://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dmh/1075894_MentalHealthServices_MHS_ActiveInterventions.pdf\" id=\"\"> accessible PDF</a> can be a starting point.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Document Any Crises or Safety Concerns</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It is important to concisely document any<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\"> potential risk factors or crises</a> when you write clinical notes. Most healthcare organizations have established protocols for such documentation, but you may need to consult with other providers if you need additional support.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Demonstrate assessment of risk: </strong>Document the level of risk posed to the client or other people. Indicate which established risk assessments were utilized and the rationale for engaging in those methods.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Interventions: </strong>Document the specific interventions taken to address the safety concerns, including referrals to other professionals, safety plans, or grounding techniques.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consultation documentation: </strong>If you consulted with another therapist, physician, or healthcare professional, document their involvement and recommendations.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Follow-up plans: </strong>Document future plans related to follow-up, ongoing support, protective factors, test results, lab results, next session, and changes to the treatment plan.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Stick to a Consistent Protocol</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most clinicians find that their note-writing process feels far more manageable when they commit to a predictable paperwork schedule. This is especially true if you have a large caseload or seemingly inconsistent client appointments.</p><p id=\"\">Procrastinating may feel beneficial in the short term, but it always comes with emotional consequences, such as more anxiety, feelings of insecurity, or tension with your colleagues or supervisor. When it comes to the integrity of your work, procrastination may also come with logistical consequences, including delayed payouts, insurance audits, and more.</p><p id=\"\">When it comes to<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life\" id=\"\"> optimizing time management</a>, committing to any new habit can take time. On average, it can take anywhere from 18-254 days for a habit to feel more consistent and static. And even then, daily repetition matters when it comes to maintaining a sense of predictability.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How to Speed Up Your Notes</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Like most healthcare professionals, you're probably extremely busy and don't have a lot of time between each appointment or therapy session. That said, with practice, you should be able to pare down each note to just a few minutes. Here's a step-by-step guide that can help you save time and write more concise notes.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Use the Same Format Each Time Standard Format</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Whether you're writing a SOAP note, DAP note, BIRP note, or something else, keep your note-writing process consistent each time. The more you stick to a predictable routine, the more you'll implement an inherent flow to writing.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Consider Whether You Want to Take Notes in Session</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Jotting down notes during each session can save time. It also may ensure greater accuracy, as you're recording details in real-time rather than relying on your memory later. Certain organizations require that documentation is completed within designated timeframes, and taking notes in session can mitigate the risk of lateness.</p><p id=\"\">With that, some clients and clinicians may find the process of writing notes to be distracting. You can't be as engaged with the client's response as it unfolds in each moment, and clients will inherently wonder what you're writing down as they speak.</p><p id=\"\">Some organizations have already moved to embrace<a href=\"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.20230118\" id=\"\"> collaborative documentation</a>. Collaboration documentation entails both the clinician and client participating in documentation together during the session. This is intended to be a patient-centered approach that assesses current needs, personal goals, interventions, and progress.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Dictate Clinical Notes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Many providers find it better to dictate their paperwork than to write or type it. Start by selecting your preferred HIPAA-compliant dictation software. You want to use a program that encrypts data during its transmission and storage to prohibit any unauthorized access. Ideally, this program will also mandate multi-user authentication methods like PINs, biometrics, or strong passwords.</p><p id=\"\">Always review each software's particular security features and compliance standards to make sure they fit with your regulatory requirements.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Familiarize Yourself With Your EMR</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Having <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-complete-guide-to-facility-management-software-in-behavioral-health-how-navix-health-enhances-operations\" id=\"\">reliable EMR software</a> is paramount for improving your note-writing process, treatment plans, and managing a multidisciplinary team. Every EMR has its own unique features, and it's important to familiarize yourself with what's available to you.</p><p id=\"\">Navix Health is created for healthcare professionals, and it is also designed and maintained by healthcare professionals who feel the current products on the market are too rigid and cumbersome.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Research shows that, in all industries, the average worker is productive for just about 60% of the day. 100% isn't necessarily the goal, but improving productivity can help you feel more confident and balanced at work. If you have your own practice, boosting overall productivity can also help you obtain more clients and retain more money.</p><p id=\"\">Here are the top 15 tips to consider.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Track Time for Workplace Productivity</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The first step to understanding your productivity at work is assessing how you spend the bulk of your day. You might think you fill your time meeting with clients. But a time tracking tool may reveal just how much time you spend <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\">completing paperwork</a>, making phone calls, spending time on social media, and more.</p><p id=\"\">Tracking time becomes especially crucial if you want to <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-setting-fees-in-private-practice-and-what-to-avoid\" id=\"\">raise rates</a> or hire new staff. You need to know how much your TOTAL working hours cost (and not just the amount you earn per client). Likewise, when you track time, you inevitably start to save time because you're less prone to distraction.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Implement The Two-Minute Rule</strong></h2><p id=\"\">If you struggle with procrastination, the 2-minute rule is one of the simplest productivity hacks. The premise is simple: if a task takes fewer than two minutes to complete, do it as soon as you can.</p><p id=\"\">You can scale this down to nearly every task on your list. \"Finish all my paperwork\" becomes \"Finish one section of a note.\" \"Redo my website\" becomes \"Open my website editor.\"</p><p id=\"\">The idea of this productivity tip is to make a challenging habit simpler to start. Anyone can do something for two minutes, and this is how people learn to master time-blocking.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Act 'As If' You're Productive to Build More Productivity at Work</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The 'fake-it-til-you-make-it' trick can work well with completing certain tasks and feeling more productive. If possible, try to imagine that you're your own role model. Do what you consider a productive therapist might do. And if you struggle, aim to practice that same level of kindness and self-compassion you'd extend to them (or to a client).</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Make Two To-Do Lists (Instead of One To-Do List) Each Morning</strong></h2><p id=\"\">To-do lists are popular when it comes to workplace productivity and for a good reason. Putting it on paper makes it real, and when it feels real, it's more likely to get done.</p><p id=\"\">This dual strategy, however, can be essential for increasing work productivity. On the first list, write down everything that absolutely must be done by the end of the day. This includes everything from client sessions to insurance reviews to sending emails. The key is to ONLY put down the tasks that need to be finished by the time you end work.</p><p id=\"\">On the second list, write down anything that you'd like to get done. Even though these aren't low-priority tasks, they aren't as timely as the tasks on the first list. Having this list provides you reference on what you can do next if you have a last-minute cancellation or finish a certain task faster than expected.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Know When Your Energy Is Highest</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most people find that it's better to prioritize their most important tasks during their peak energy levels. With that, if you're a morning person, aim to focus on seeing clients during the earlier hours. If you tend to lose steam around 2 pm, consider scheduling that block of time for lunch or reading emails.</p><p id=\"\">Increasing productivity is about knowing what works best for you. Some people also benefit from starting with smaller tasks to build confidence and competence throughout the day. Completing them then helps them feel motivated to tackle more tasks.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Set Your Phone to 'Do Not Disturb'</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The average U.S. smartphone owner receives over<a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/marketplace/push-notifications/research/push-notifications-statistics/\" id=\"\"> 46 notifications</a> each day.</p><p id=\"\">While certain reminders may have some merit, every time you check your phone, you risk wasting time reading, scrolling, and spending time away from work. Silencing your phone, changing the settings to 'do not disturb', or putting your phone somewhere else altogether can help improve productivity.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Stop Multitasking (Even Repetitive Tasks)</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Research shows that the overwhelming majority of people can't multitask well. When you try to multitask, you inevitably waste time switching from one task to another. This can cause you to make mistakes, and it can actually hinder your business success.</p><p id=\"\">Instead, take a note from some of the most renowned business leaders and focus on completing each task at a time. It may feel more tedious, but your work performance will likely improve in ways you didn't expect.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Take Even More Short Breaks</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Although it may seem counterintuitive, prioritizing more regular breaks during the day may boost your productivity and better help you meet your own deadlines.</p><p id=\"\">Some studies suggest that it's optimal to rest for about 20 minutes for every 90 minutes of work. This math can work nicely for therapists- for every 45-50-minute session, allot yourself those 10 minutes to relax. If you struggle to allow yourself time for rest, remind yourself that these breaks are built in to help you stay focused on the most important task- the ability to help your clients.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Make Monthly Goals for Your Practice</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Adhering to a to-do list ensures that you complete tasks each day. But don't make the mistake of getting so lost in the day-to-day work that you lose sight of your big-picture goals.</p><p id=\"\">What are your career dreams? Do you want to open your practice? Do you want to expand your current practice into a <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/14-essential-questions-therapists-need-to-consider-before-opening-a-group-practice\" id=\"\">group practice</a>? Do you want to get certified in a new modality, write a book, or pursue some other professional creative project?</p><p id=\"\">These dreams require more planning than daily to-do lists, so it's helpful to sit down and draft your monthly goals each month. Then, you can break down those goals into specific tasks to follow each day or week.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Outsource At Least One Task Right Now</strong></h2><p id=\"\">One of the worst mistakes a therapist can make is doing absolutely everything themselves. While that strategy can save money, the effects may only be short-lived. Sometimes, increasing personal productivity means knowing when to prioritize delegating tasks to other people. This can reduce the burden of time-consuming tasks, freeing you to focus on what matters most: client care.</p><p id=\"\">Therapists can outsource many tasks, including:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Hiring a virtual assistant for graphic design and social media</li><li id=\"\">Using a bookkeeper to manage the books</li><li id=\"\">Hiring another therapist to manage new intakes or an overflow of clients</li><li id=\"\">Using automated tools to manage scheduling</li><li id=\"\">Working with a biller to manage insurance needs</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Optimize Your Work Environment</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Therapists know the importance of having an ideal environment for their clients. But have you ever considered how your environment impacts your own productivity levels?</p><p id=\"\">Think about what helps you feel inspired. If you work from home, it's paramount to have a space that feels both cozy and inviting. Prioritize natural light and comfort. Remember that clutter can be distracting, so at the end of each work day, tidy up (and do a deeper clean about once a week). Invest in tools that will help you do your job faster and with more ease (i.e. an ergonomic chair, a portable coffee maker, necessary office supplies).</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Set Fixed Work-Life Boundaries</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Many people feel they can be more productive at work when they preserve their emotional energy at home. Barring emergencies, try to ensure that you complete all clinical and administrative tasks when you're at work. This creates a clear separation of time, and that can help you feel more focused when you need to be focused.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Look After Your Physical Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">All the productivity techniques in the world won't make much of a difference if you feel completely sluggish or worn down. Every therapist knows that dreaded feeling of mental exhaustion- it hurts both you and your clients, and it can be a <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-self-care-tips-for-managing-therapist-burnout\" id=\"\">driving catalyst of burnout</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Having enough energy during the workday is key to boosting productivity. This starts from the inside, and it includes engaging in self-care, such as eating nutritious foods regularly, getting plenty of physical exercise, and ensuring that you get enough sleep.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Talk to Your Own Therapist About Issues With Time Management</strong></h2><p id=\"\">If you're still struggling to increase employee productivity despite integrating these suggestions, it may be beneficial to meet with your own therapist. Many mental health problems, including anxiety, ADHD, and depression can interfere with your business productivity and <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life\" id=\"\">time management</a>.</p><p id=\"\">Every productivity system is highly individual, and the value of all the tasks you need to complete inherently differs from that of therapists or employees. You may find that you get more value working through some of the underlying issues impacting your productivity than simply trying to bulldoze your way through important projects.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Optimize Your EMR System With Navix Health</strong></h2><p id=\"\">We know that onboarding new clients, making treatment plans, filling out insurance forms, and completing notes are among the most tedious (and dreaded) tasks for therapists. Better productivity starts with implementing better systems.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we provide a comprehensive platform so mental health professionals can increase productivity and optimize their business strategy. We are constantly reshaping and redefining how we support company leaders, and we provide a variety of custom tools to help you better help your clients.</p><p id=\"\">Get in touch with us today to<a href=\"https://calendly.com/d/yk9-xfc-stg/navix-demo\" id=\"\"> schedule your custom demo</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Workers' mental health and general welfare are receiving increased attention from a growing number of company executives and HR specialists. Despite this, many employees still hesitate to report mental health difficulties to their supervisors. This is primarily due to their fear of jeopardizing their professional reputation or causing new troubles. Learning the issue is one thing; understanding how to support those experiencing mental health issues and inspire good well-being is quite another.</p><h2 id=\"\">Human Connection Is Essential For Happiness</h2><p id=\"\">It is possible for employers to leverage the power of simple human connection to prevent mental health concerns in the workplace. Nobody is to blame for mental illness. Nobody chooses to be anxious or depressed. Occupational stress can be managed and minimized with the correct remedies.</p><p id=\"\">Those who have a colleague or friend at work are seven times more likely to be engaged and productive than employees who do not have a colleague or friend at work. People with mental health issues at work can benefit from our ability to smile, laugh, and communicate with our coworkers. They could be bosses or coworkers.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Deal with Employees with Mental Health Issues</h2><p id=\"\">When selecting how to manage employees with mental health issues, numerous crucial elements must be considered. There is no \"one-size-fits-all\" solution, but the advice in this article can help you determine the best course of action and create a helpful culture.</p><p id=\"\">Making the workplace a safe place for employees to be candid about their feelings includes eliminating the stigma associated with mental illness. This could greatly impact other crucial areas, such as flexible working, performance management, and extended resources.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Gathering Information</h3><p id=\"\">You will be able to deal with the situation more successfully if you completely understand what the unstable employee is going through. To know how to proceed, you must first identify whether the individual has a mental illness that is causing their instability. Examine to check if a proper diagnosis has been made. Other times, the worker is dealing with a stressful situation at work or at home, which causes emotional or mental instability. Make a note of every interruption you witness at work to establish a behavioral history. Take note of the date, hour, and circumstances around any incidences of employee outbursts, violence, or other unfavorable interactions with her coworkers.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Help the Mentally Unstable Employee</h3><p id=\"\">If the unstable employee recognizes your willingness to help him, he may be more open to your efforts, especially if he receives expert help on the side. Set up a regular check-in with the employee via a meeting or monitoring system. Another method for assisting him is to provide instruction or information to the rest of the employees on how to deal with the employee. You help other employees understand how to communicate with him, which helps to reduce confrontation.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Create a Fictitious Water Cooler Moment</h3><p id=\"\">The human element of our work has suffered as a direct result of our decision to perform most of it from the comfort of our homes, but that does not mean it has to go entirely. Conversation over coffee is still feasible, but only through a computer screen. Begin by committing to connecting with coworkers online, away from work-related conversation, even if it means foregoing the intimate touch of eye contact.</p><p id=\"\">Social circles impact the favorable work environments we create, promoting productivity and mental health. Human connection improves general performance and morale in addition to the coworkers watching out for help.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Make Yourself a Great Listener</h3><p id=\"\">Contrary to popular belief, a mental health strategy does not require free mental health counseling and yoga courses. While many employees will naturally benefit from these advantages, they might put financial pressure on firm budgets. Instead, harness the power of listening to manage employees who are dealing with mental health issues.</p><p id=\"\">It is possible to listen through the employees' line managers, senior managers, or coworkers. The possibility that an employee will feel compelled to discuss their mental health issues is determined by the following factors:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">What instruments do I have at my disposal?</li><li id=\"\">Will my employer assist me?</li><li id=\"\">How accommodating is my workplace to mental health issues?</li></ul><p id=\"\">Active listening to employees not only helps to de-stigmatize mental health concerns at work, but it also catalyzes prevention. Employers are not psychotherapists; therefore, employees should not expect them to monitor or understand every mental health issue. As a result, neither management nor employees should place anyone under any pressure to take up this job at work.</p><p id=\"\">Listening with empathy, on the other hand, is a critical component of a workplace health strategy. Encourage everyone in the office to be ready to listen to a coworker who is experiencing stress or mental health issues. This enhances workplace connections and gives managers a better understanding of employee well-being.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Maintain a Positive Attitude</h3><p id=\"\">When dealing with a mental health crisis, it is difficult to see and think clearly; hence the individual may be self-critical. They may have received unsatisfactory performance evaluations or missed deadlines. However, as a leader, it is critical that you focus on the positive aspects of the situation.</p><p id=\"\">Employee motivation weakens when depressed or anxious since so much of their energy is dedicated to survival. Instead of instilling fear in them by explaining the negative consequences of an incomplete project, check in with them and explain the advantages of completing a task.</p><p id=\"\">Remember why you hired them. Concentrate on the chores they excel at and play to their strengths during these times. They most likely prioritize tasks in which they excel. When employees feel valued and beneficial, they are more motivated to finish duties, which can lead to higher productivity and a happy team.</p><h2 id=\"\">Takeaways</h2><p id=\"\">The best course of action is prevention rather than cure. To successfully manage people with mental health issues, the key is creating a positive and enjoyable work environment. Toxic workplaces are havens for stress and mental illness. Be upfront and honest with your employees because doing so allows you to learn more about them and fosters productive workplaces.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">If you're like most of us, you go outside yourself for answers when you're going through a difficult period, experiencing disturbing symptoms, or need to make some life adjustments. And you will discover that many individuals are eager to guide you, make decisions for you, and act on your behalf. You can seek help from your spouse or another family member, friends, co-workers, a religious or spiritual adviser, a counselor or therapist, a medical doctor, or medical experts such as a psychiatrist, a nutritionist, or an acupuncturist – the list is endless. While many of these persons may be able to offer some assistance, knowledge, or direction, you may neglect the most crucial authority — yourself. If you ignore your inner direction as a source of knowledge, your actions may be counterproductive.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Can I Do For My Mental Health?</h2><p id=\"\">If you look for how to treat mental illness on the internet, you'll find a lot of information on meds and treatment. That also applies to; drugs and therapy are significant components of many people's treatment. However, both require the assistance of a specialist. This might give the impression that your mental health is in someone else's hands. Fortunately, there are numerous things you can do to take charge of your mental health.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Educate Yourself</h3><p id=\"\">Learn everything there is to know about the subject or issues at hand. Make sure what you're learning feels correct to you as you study. Remember, just because it is in a book by a well-known author or on a website does not imply it is correct or appropriate for you. For example, many people with psychiatric diagnoses are told that they will never recover, that they will never be able to have children, that they will never be able to be in an intimate relationship, that they will never be able to attend college, or that they will never be able to pursue their desired career. Education will enable you to form your own opinions on each problem. You may decide that you disagree with the diagnosis or that no one can diagnose you with anything. You might choose to conceive of your symptoms as emotions rather than diagnoses.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Make a Treatment Plan</h3><p id=\"\">There are several therapy methods available for mental health disorders. Here are several examples:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Therapy (group or individual) </li><li id=\"\">Medication.</li><li id=\"\">Groups of support (online or in-person)</li><li id=\"\">Changes in lifestyle, such as getting more sleep, eating foods that make you feel better, and doing more activity.</li><li id=\"\">Journaling about herbal supplements</li><li id=\"\">Learning how to reframe negative beliefs</li></ul><p id=\"\">Some of these, such as drugs and treatment, need collaboration with a specialist. However, many of these are things you can perform on your own. The majority of people will benefit from a mix of therapies.</p><p id=\"\">You're building together a treatment plan as you test out different therapies and determine which ones work and which don't. This does not have to be official; it can just be a mental note of what works and what does not.</p><p id=\"\">The most effective therapies are those that:</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Choose What You Want</h3><p id=\"\">Most mental health therapies are time-consuming. Suppose you're having difficulty sticking with your therapy. In that case, you have two choices: discover ways to be more consistent (such as using an app to track your behaviors) or locate another treatment that you're more likely to keep with.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Have Faith</h3><p id=\"\">Anyone who offers therapy to you should be able to explain why. You don't need to understand all of the scientific aspects of how it works (unless you find it fascinating!), but studying before trying something new is a good idea.</p><p id=\"\">Complement One Another</p><p id=\"\">There are several causes and symptoms of mental diseases. Many therapies target only one or two of them. Combining therapies that target several causes or symptoms can allow you to cover all of your bases.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Openness To New Ideas</h3><p id=\"\">Something that used to operate well may have a different impact. You could also discover a new treatment that you'd like to try. Maintain your adaptability and openness to new ideas!</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Journaling</h3><p id=\"\">The practice of writing might help you comprehend how you truly feel about something. Refrain from being concerned about your handwriting or punctuation. Fill in the blanks with whatever you're thinking or feeling. It can be imperfect. It may all be imagination. It might be thoughts, feelings, emotional expressions, ideas, goals, or anything else you wish. You are not obligated to show it to anyone if you do not choose to. Others should respect the confidentiality of your work. When you have time, reread your writings.</p><h3 id=\"\">7.Putting Together a Therapy Team</h3><p id=\"\">You are not required to devise your treatment plan. A mental health expert, such as a doctor or therapist, can assist you. You can also seek assistance from your support system, which includes friends, family members, and any online or in-person support groups you participate in.</p><p id=\"\">These poeple can provide the advice you would have thought of. They may hold you accountable and urge you to stay in your treatment plan.</p><p id=\"\">Putting together your treatment team might take some time. Some of those persons may appear and disappear over time. But it's your team—you get to decide who gets in. Remembering this can make all the difference in feeling in control of your mental health.</p><h3 id=\"\">8. Don't be too hard on yourself.</h3><p id=\"\">Every day, your best might look different. Accepting this one thing may take years, but once you do, it will be a game changer. Try journaling your thoughts before starting your day on some days.</p><h3 id=\"\">9. Open Up to Listeners</h3><p id=\"\">A competent doctor or therapist will make you an equal participant in your therapy. They will consider your suggestions and treat your concerns carefully. If you believe your doctor or therapist is not listening to you, you may always seek the advice of another professional.</p><p id=\"\">Doctors may be better knowledgeable about how pharmaceuticals function and what works best for the bulk of their patients. However, you are the authority on your own experiences. Mental wellness is incredibly individual! What works for one person may not work for another. Mental health specialists can be an important component of your treatment team.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Meditation is the practice of focusing on one's thoughts for a prolonged period of time. There are several techniques of meditation, but the most common result is a sensation of inner peace and relaxation, which can improve mental health. An increasing body of data supports the connection between meditation and mental wellness.</p><h2 id=\"\">What Is Meditation?</h2><p id=\"\">Relax and focus on your work while sitting in comfort. You may focus on your breath, an object or vision, or a mantra (a repeating phrase or sound). This attention aids in freeing the mind of tension- and anxiety-inducing ideas.</p><p id=\"\">Slowly and thoroughly inhale. Relax your neck, shoulders, and chest muscles. &nbsp;Allow your thoughts to pass through your mind without evaluating them.</p><p id=\"\">Multiple studies have proved the benefits of regular meditation.</p><p id=\"\">Reduced stress, enhanced concentration, decreased blood pressure, and less anxiety and depressive symptoms are a few examples.</p><h2 id=\"\">How Can Meditation Affect One's Mental Health?</h2><p id=\"\">A person's mental health is the result of a nuanced interplay of numerous factors, including their physical well-being, relationships, social and economic circumstances, and core beliefs and values. A person's social life is a significant element of their mental health. Positive interpersonal relationships and interactions boost overall mental health. Some mental health problems, such as depression, may be more prevalent in those with a family history of them. Personality is a factor; some individuals are naturally more resilient or optimistic than others, and this is also an important facet of mental health.</p><p id=\"\">The good news is that regardless of genetics or environment, individuals can do much to improve their mental health and favorably influence their lives. Meditation is among these.</p><p id=\"\">Meditation is beneficial to mental health because it improves attention and focus, increases self-awareness and self-esteem, reduces stress, and calms racing thoughts. Nevertheless, the benefits do not end there.</p><h2 id=\"\">Benefits of Meditation for Mental Health</h2><p id=\"\">Although there are several types of meditation, they may all deliver the same mental and physical health benefits. Here is what research has revealed.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Anxiety Management</h3><p id=\"\">If you're like the majority of us, you have a full schedule. There is almost always something to be concerned about. Anxiety arises when your stress response becomes hyperactive, resulting in a variety of physical and emotional symptoms like rapid breathing, dizziness, insomnia, lack of appetite, and a rapid heartbeat. In acute anxiety, worry becomes so excessive or overwhelming that it interferes with everyday life and the ability to deal with regular obstacles.</p><p id=\"\">General Hospital Psychiatry published a three-year clinical experiment utilizing mindfulness meditation to illustrate the mental health benefits of meditation for anxiety. Researchers observed significant improvement and long-term benefits in patients with anxiety and anxiety disorders.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Managing Phobias and Fears</h3><p id=\"\">Fear and phobias are manifestations of anxiety, and just as meditation may help reduce anxiety, it can also help conquer phobias and fear. As a unique treatment for phobias such as agoraphobia (fear of going outside), fear of flying, and dread of public speaking, some psychologists have begun to offer meditation to their patients.</p><p id=\"\">Although research is still in its infancy, there is some evidence that meditation can assist some individuals in overcoming their concerns. This study's findings suggest that combining mindfulness training with exposure treatment may result in greater and more long-lasting therapeutic advantages.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Concerning Oneself With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders</h3><p id=\"\">OCD is another anxiety-related disorder that can have devastating effects on daily life. There is an ongoing search for therapy or a 'cure' for OCD sufferers in order for them to let go of their obsessions and compulsions and live a life free from general anxiety and distraction.</p><p id=\"\">Meditation is usually recommended to those seeking methods to better manage and cope with obsessive-compulsive disorders since it educates the brain to concentrate and restore calm. The use of meditation to treat OCD is still being investigated, although there is already evidence of the scientific benefits of combining meditation with other OCD therapies.</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Reduction of Negative Self-Image and Alteration of Beliefs</h3><p id=\"\">Having a negative self-image is commonly rooted in childhood due to unfulfilled emotional needs. When a person has bad sentiments about themselves, others may respond with negative emotions and advice. And the vicious cycle of low self-esteem grows worse. Attending talk therapy to uncover the underlying causes of negative self-beliefs is a crucial element of self-development and a major milestone on the road to a better life for many people. Negative self-beliefs can be effectively treated using mindfulness meditation as a supplement to psychotherapy or as a stand-alone self-help technique.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Eliminating Social Anxiety</h3><p id=\"\">Social anxiety may affect your work, education, and other daily activities. The intense, constant dread of being assessed by others can impede the formation and maintenance of relationships, leading to isolation and loneliness.</p><p id=\"\">Because mindfulness meditation has been demonstrated to lower anxiety and improve self-focus, it can increase self-assurance and social skills, hence reducing social anxiety over time. A study published in the National Library of Medicine demonstrated the benefits of mindfulness-based stress reduction on the brains of persons with social anxiety disorder, with patients experiencing reduced social anxiety and melancholy. It also shows an increase in self-esteem.</p><h2 id=\"\">Conclusion</h2><p id=\"\">The sooner you begin meditating, the sooner you will experience its benefits. Incorporating meditation into your daily routine, ideally, every day, may really reorganize the brain and deliver good mental health advantages, but this is not a fast cure. Even better, you do not need to complete a course or join a group to receive these benefits; you may meditate at home, on your own time, whenever it is convenient for you.</p><p id=\"\">Thanks to advancements in biofeedback technology, you may also obtain real-time information on the physiological and neurological effects of meditation. Historically, biofeedback requires a visit to a clinic or therapist. There is now reasonably affordable and sophisticated biofeedback equipment for the home that may help you relax and evaluate the effectiveness of your meditation practice.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "blog-content": "Virtual care has the potential to close the healthcare disparities that exist in the United States due to unequal access to quality healthcare, social determinants of health, and implicit bias.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted in 2010, the goal was to provide healthcare to all Americans. Yet, more than a decade later, the United States witnesses significant healthcare disparities, despite spending more on healthcare than any other country in the world.</p><p id=\"\">Many factors contribute to healthcare disparities, but the three most common are unequal access to quality healthcare, social determinants of health, and implicit bias.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, minorities and those who live in rural regions face several barriers to getting medical treatment, including poorer finances, restricted transportation options, and long travel times. As a result, there is a higher chance that people living in these neighborhoods may develop chronic health issues, including diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. So, patients from<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108512/\" id=\"\"> racial and ethnic minority</a> groups are almost twice as likely to experience chronic illnesses as Caucasians, which may contribute to Black or African American individuals in the United States having a four-year shorter average life <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/data-finder.htm?year=2019&table=Table%20004\" id=\"\">expectancy</a> than White people.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, systemic racism contributes to poor health outcomes, as seen by the rising COVID-19 death rates among communities of color. Immigrants have a higher risk of sickness and less access to medical treatment, which is worsened by the fact that those residing in rural areas are more prone to falling prey to illnesses. The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3540621/\" id=\"\">National Institute of Health</a> (NIH) reports that healthcare disparities often result in a lower quality of care for marginalized groups.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">Reducing healthcare disparities is a complex task that requires effort from many different sectors, including government, healthcare organizations, communities, and individuals. Its negative impact on the quality and quantity of life of those affected makes it a priority to combat.<br></p><p id=\"\">Fortunately, virtual care can significantly close these disparities by creating more equitably distributed health outcomes that result from the elimination of conventional treatment restrictions in the following ways:<br></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Removing Barriers.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Problems such as lack of access to a vehicle or living far away often result in patients missing their doctor's appointments. In fact, those with the highest disease burden also have the most significant<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0361198105192400110\" id=\"\"> mobility hurdles</a> and are more likely to be older, poorer, less educated, female, persons of color, and those with impairments or chronic diseases. Virtual care can remove such barriers by connecting patients with providers who they might not otherwise be able to access due to distance, transportation, or mobility issues.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">Additionally, it is challenging to guarantee patient safety, provide high-quality healthcare, and increase patient and medical staff satisfaction when <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32411417/\" id=\"\">language barriers</a> are involved. These can be removed with virtual care since providers can use interpretation services during virtual visits.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=\"\">Through virtual care, doctors may even be able to determine social barriers that keep a patient from receiving care, like food insecurity, racial prejudice when gaining access to services, or even trouble getting health insurance. This information can allow healthcare professionals to get involved and take necessary action.<br></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Cost Reduction.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">People without primary care physicians may visit urgent care facilities or emergency rooms when a health problem arises. However, virtual care offers them a more practical and inexpensive alternative by providing telemedicine services, basically virtual versions of urgent care clinics, especially for those without health insurance or high deductible plans. With these services, consumers are told upfront of the cost of an online consultation, preventing hefty surprise fees later. Moreover, the cost of transportation is also diminished.<br></p><p id=\"\">Virtual care is also typically less expensive than in-person options because these encounters don't always require extra employees. Some insurance companies even provide free 24-hour nurse lines or telemedicine visits as part of their coverage, which is a great way to avoid the sometimes high copayments.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Enable Patients to Manage Recurring Conditions.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The best ways to manage a chronic ailment are typically not fully understood by patients with limited healthcare access. Regular virtual care contact can be used as a teaching technique to assist patients in better managing their condition. In addition, it can empower patients to take greater control of their health by providing them with educational resources online. Regular check-ins with patients via teleconference can help to ensure that they stay on track with their health goals, which can prevent serious health complications that may arise as a result of the chronic illness. Additionally, teleconferencing can help patients keep appointments with specialists who may not be accessible otherwise.<br></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Higher Inclusivity.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Clinical studies have consistently shown racial and ethnic differences. Clinical trials that do not adequately include members of racial/ethnic minority groups as participants lead to the creation of therapies that do not effectively treat various populations or transfer to real-world applications.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Getting to the actual clinical study site is one of the main obstacles to participation. In a standard trial, patients must frequently travel to a central location for evaluations, the delivery of therapy, testing to track results, and the dispensing of drugs for at-home use. This can take several hours every trip and cost money for food and transportation. These constraints discriminate against people with little discretionary cash, limited transit alternatives, rigid job schedules, and family responsibilities.</p><p id=\"\">However, by utilizing remote patient monitoring (RPM), distance obstacles are reduced and time is saved, allowing for more patient involvement and data collection that can help researchers better assess the experiment's validity.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Eliminate inequities with Navix Health.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In order to lessen the effects of healthcare inequalities on your patients in marginalized regions, Navix Health provides virtual care solutions to fundamentally alter the way behavioral healthcare businesses operate by allowing ease of virtual communication to practitioners so they can devote their attention to the (online and off-line) patient, who is ultimately what matters.</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Effective therapy entails collaborating together to set reasonable expectations for treatment. It’s not uncommon for clients to enter treatment not really knowing what will happen. Some clients come into their intake session sincerely hoping you can change the course of their life. Others come in and state that they “know” they need help, but they don’t know what to talk about. </p><p id=\"\">To complicate matters, therapists don’t always know how to set the best goals with their clients either. This can be especially true if treatment is limited in terms of session frequency- or if the client presents with numerous issues that need addressing.</p><p id=\"\">Goal-setting keeps both client and therapist on track to increase the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes. And in the age of managed care, proper goal-setting is essential for proper authorization when working with third-party payers.</p><h2 id=\"\">An Overview of Goal Setting in Therapy </h2><p id=\"\">Successful treatment needs to adhere to overarching treatment goals. What are you hoping to help the client achieve? How will you align your therapeutic process to best support their mental health? And are you both on the same page with what you're actually addressing?</p><p id=\"\">The first step is collaborating with clients to form your treatment plan. What's bringing them to therapy at this time? Do they feel they have realistic goals? What's causing them the most distress during their life? How are they hoping the counseling relationship will help them feel better?</p><p id=\"\">Knowing these answers as early as the intake will help you structure your therapy sessions and develop achievable goals. Today, many providers favor smart goals for their treatment.</p><h3 id=\"\">1. Invite the Client to Share What They Want to Be Changed</h3><p id=\"\">A client should always have permission to share their therapy goals freely. This discussion should start as early as the intake process. It's also important to assess how current distress impacts daily life and whether the client currently believes their goals for therapy are achievable.</p><p id=\"\">Reviewing goals is both pragmatic and encouraging. In addition, when a client feels hopeful that you can help them meet their goals, they may be more invested in the therapy process.</p><p id=\"\">Clients with acute levels of anxiety symptoms, depression, or low self-esteem may struggle to believe things can ever change. Negative self-talk makes it hard to manage difficult emotions or implement healthy coping techniques. It's your job to hold space for the client and believe that growth is possible.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. Always Consider Imminent Crisis Issues Within The Treatment Plan</h3><p id=\"\">Stabilizing acute crises must always take precedence when it comes to managing therapeutic goals. It's exceedingly difficult to focus on overall life wellness or personal development when a client is facing potentially life-threatening situations.</p><p id=\"\">Proper assessment is key in obtaining information about these crises, particularly when it comes to suicidal ideation, acute substance use, or severe mental health symptoms. Mental health support at this time may include wraparound treatment. Subsequently, the goals for therapy may include supporting clients with referrals to other providers.</p><p id=\"\">A client may downplay or withhold their truth because they fear being judged. Maintaining a warm, empathic presence can't be overstated.</p><h3 id=\"\">3. Review What’s Helped In The Past</h3><p id=\"\">Discuss what your client has done to try to work on these therapy goals in the past. What kind of self-care has been helpful? What normally gives them a sense of self-confidence? What healthier ways have they tried implementing to improve their mental health symptoms?</p><p id=\"\">Don't just limit the conversation to what they've worked on in previous treatment episodes. Consider any steps they have personally taken toward trying to change.</p><p id=\"\">Ask when life has felt different in the past. What were they doing? Who were they spending time with? How did they stay motivated in making progress toward their goals?</p><h3 id=\"\">4. Contextualize Other Mental Health Conditions</h3><p id=\"\">Clients often come to treatment with a myriad of presenting issues. This can pose a challenge for even the most seasoned clinicians. What therapy goal do you start with when there are so many items to address?</p><p id=\"\">It's important to remember that symptoms often overlap. When someone is seeking therapy, they need guidance in everyday life. This often includes goals focused on improving communication, strengthening self-esteem, and learning how to challenge negative thoughts.</p><h3 id=\"\">5. Explore What Hasn’t Helped Before</h3><p id=\"\">In addition to exploring what has helped, you need to also pay equal attention to what the client feels hasn't benefited them. This may include certain support groups, therapeutic interventions, medications, or coping skills.</p><p id=\"\">Be careful of automatically assuming these methods can't work right now. What didn't help in the past might speak to your client's level of motivation or support network. That said, you may encounter more pushback if you suggest these interventions without compassion.</p><h3 id=\"\">6. Normalize Lapses and Regression</h3><p id=\"\">Providers must normalize the setbacks that often occur during the therapeutic process.</p><p id=\"\">All change is hard, and many clients feel afraid or ashamed of their struggles. Some will come to therapy expecting fast progress and transformative change. The setbacks can be even more discouraging.</p><p id=\"\">This is where it can be helpful to teach clients the benefits of practicing self-compassion. As they try to meet their actionable goals, they will encounter challenges along the way. It's essential for them to learn how to bounce back and stay on track.</p><h3 id=\"\">7. Empower Autonomous Thinking </h3><p id=\"\">Fostering an unhealthy attachment to a therapist can be damaging to the relationship. It can also stunt a client's emotional growth.</p><p id=\"\">Ultimately, clients need to learn how to carry what they learn in treatment out in the real world. They can and should rely on you for support, but the work becomes problematic when you become the sole source of support. Encourage your client to build positive relationships with people who can provide them with validation and guidance.</p><h2 id=\"\">Reassess Goals Together</h2><p id=\"\">Setting goals for therapy keeps treatment on track. But the goal-setting process is never static. You should revisit the validity of these goals- and how your client is feeling toward their progress often.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

You want to ensure that the space feels comfortable, inviting, and safe for your clients. Here are the best ways to optimize your waiting space.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Don't Assume Potential Clients Know Who You Are (Or Where You Are)</strong></h2><p id=\"\">You provided your address on the consultation call. You followed it up with an email reminder, and it's posted on your website. But chances are, during that first session, your client is feeling anxious and unsettled, and the last thing they need is to scramble to find your office at the last moment.</p><p id=\"\">This is why having clear, transparent signage is so important. Clients should absolutely know that they're in the right place. This means that you need to have explicit signs indicating that you work in that office.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Logistical checklist:</strong></p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">How will you know your client is in the waiting room (will they press a light switch? Will they check in on a tablet or with a receptionist? Will you simply come out and get them at the right time?)</li><li id=\"\">If you are in a suite number, can they clearly track where you work from the parking lot?</li><li id=\"\">Is it clear where they can wait for you (i.e. are the chairs organized in a friendly and inviting way?)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Engage All Five Senses in the Therapeutic Waiting Room</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Mental health services are vulnerable services, and they require a significant investment of both time and money. You want your waiting areas to authentically represent the safety and compassion you strive to emulate within your therapeutic practice.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sight: </strong>What kind of mood are you hoping to inspire? How does your physical design represent a sense of psychological safety? When you look around at the waiting room decorative items, what feelings come up for you? Remember to keep the area free from clutter and make sure to have a trashcan available for clients.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Smell: </strong>Be mindful of allergies and other aversions to strong scents. It's better to have a neutral smell than a strong fragrance. Some clinicians opt to light a candle or have a diffuser. Make sure to periodically check the waiting room furniture to check for any lingering smells.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sound: </strong>Consider playing pleasant classical tunes in the waiting room. Avoid harsh lyrics or anything that may be deemed too contemporary or controversial. If the office gets noisy with numerous staff going in and out, consider using a white noise machine instead.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Taste: </strong>While it's not necessary, consider offering water, tea, coffee, or mints in the waiting room. Clients often consider this to be a nice touch, and it can help alleviate initial nerves. If you work with children or adolescents, consider stashing snacks for them.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Physical feelings: </strong>How comfortable are the seats? Are they spaced too closely together? Are the cushions soft and inviting? Are you mindful of the temperature? People don't like to be too hot or too cold, so keep that in mind as they are sitting and waiting for you. Consider having tissues available as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Incorporate Meaningful Artwork and Decor</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Artwork and decor add personalization to your waiting space, and this can play an important role in overall sensory modulation. However, it's <em id=\"\">essential </em>to be authentic in the message you convey. Just like everything with mental illness, strive to be mindful of cheesy cliches and try to avoid potential triggers.</p><p id=\"\">Inclusivity matters. Consider your population and make sure that your waiting room reflects their needs and values. This is part of your branding, which means it’s both part of your <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make\" id=\"\">therapeutic marketing</a> <em id=\"\">and </em>your clinical presence. You don't want to perpetuate negative stigmas about discrimination or implicit biases. When in doubt, nature scenes tend to be soothing.</p><p id=\"\">Plants can also be soothing, but it's important that you only use live plants if you can commit to taking care of them. Dying or dead plants can certainly be off-putting, so if that's a risk, consider investing in a few high-quality fake ones.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Be Pleasant and Neutral When Walking Back to Your Office</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Technically <em id=\"\">any </em>form of communication with a client can be considered therapeutic.</p><p id=\"\">But the walk from the waiting room to your office shouldn't initiate the start of your session. You need to wait until you're both in the private therapeutic space to talk about your client's needs and feelings.</p><p id=\"\">You don't have to chat during the walk back to your office, but if you do, consider defaulting to fairly safe and neutral topics including the weather or any relevant current events. Clients may also use this opportunity to engage in safe small talk, and that can also be appropriate.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Integrate Any Feedback</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Despite your best efforts, practicing therapists will find that no one approach works best for everyone. Different needs call for different contexts, and even the most carefully and thoughtfully designed environment may still evoke negative reactions.</p><p id=\"\">If a client shares feedback about your waiting room or counseling space, it's important to consider their thoughts and feelings. They may be sharing something other people also feel, and such patterns may even affect overall treatment outcomes.</p><p id=\"\">When in doubt, consider soliciting feedback from trusted colleagues. It can be helpful to also tour other counseling spaces in the area to see how other providers set up their rooms.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What If You Don't Have a Waiting Room?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Not all healthcare settings are set up for therapeutic waiting areas, and that's perfectly okay. You may not be able to control this part of your office. It’s not the end of the world!</p><p id=\"\">If you don't have a waiting room, you still need to establish a protocol for how clients will communicate with you upon their arrival. Some decide to wait in their cars and text their providers to indicate they are on the premises. Others might knock on the door or simply wait outside.</p><p id=\"\">Confidentiality can certainly influence waiting area experiences, and this becomes more pronounced if you don't have a designated space. Try to be mindful of when you start and end sessions, as you may not want clients to see each other in between session times.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Navix Health Maximizes the Mental Health Service Experience</strong></h2><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we support our clinicians at every stage of their professional development.

        "blog-content": "As a result, many successful therapists struggle to fill their caseload or gain recognition. Even if you are a skilled practitioner, your business could flounder without effective marketing.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">While many therapists are taught the importance of theoretical orientation, clinical excellence, and adhering to laws and ethics, there's often little attention given to marketing. As a result, many successful therapists struggle to fill their caseload or gain recognition. Even if you are a skilled practitioner, your business could flounder without effective marketing.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Define or Speak to Your Target Audience</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Even if you don't have an overly specific niche, it's a mistake to avoid identifying your ideal clients. Trying to speak to everyone results in coming across as too generic and broad- in a saturated market, you will struggle to stand out. In addition, because therapy is so inherently intimate, it's especially important that potential clients feel seen and heard when they come across your website or marketing campaigns.</p><p id=\"\">If this is an area of weakness, consider spending some time reflecting on your caseload. What kinds of clients do you most want to work with? What are their ages, presenting problems, and innermost needs? How do other companies market to them, and where might they be most responsive to your advertising efforts?</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Inconsistent or Disregarded Branding</strong></h2><p id=\"\">One of the most common marketing marketing mistakes professionals make is coming across as inconsistent or unclear. Your brand is the \"stuff\" that separates you from other therapists; it's the essence of your practice, mission statement, and values.</p><p id=\"\">A successful marketing campaign honors branding in everything it does, from the font on the business cards to the logo on the website to the copy written in each email. Branding is an evolving art, but people should have a clear feel for who you are, what you stand for, and how you can help them when they view your marketing materials.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Take Care of Your Online Presence</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Even if you acquire clients via word-of-mouth or through an in-person referral source, you're missing out on tremendous opportunities by disregarding your company's online presence.</p><p id=\"\">At a minimum, you need to have a website that advertises your practice, specialties, and contact information. You should also have an updated LinkedIn page that showcases your work experience, accomplishments, and other professional endeavors.</p><p id=\"\">Make sure that all your headshots and written copy are current. If you no longer offer a specific service or your fees/hours have changed, make those adjustments.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ignoring or Failing to Nurture Potential Referral Sources</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Networking is an essential part of any business. The more people know about your practice, the more people can speak about your reputation and refer potential clients to you.</p><p id=\"\">One of the most common marketing mistakes professionals make is failing to network. That doesn't mean you have to attend luncheons or company parties if you're more introverted. But it does mean making an effort to know other therapists in your community and talk about your practice.</p><p id=\"\">Furthermore, depending on your population, you may have referral sources beyond therapists. For example, you might consider building a relationship with your local high schools if you work with teenagers or a medical practice if you specialize in clients with chronic pain conditions.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Moderate or Adjust Marketing Campaigns</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Many therapists set up their website only to never update it again. As you and your practice evolve, your marketing campaigns should reflect these changes. In addition, it's important to track analytics to see what's working on what's not (i.e. if you're paying to be on a specific directory, you should track how many calls/inquiries that directory generates for you).</p><p id=\"\">It's normal to need to pivot your efforts every so often. If you're in the early stages of your practice, consider spending an hour once a quarter to review your metrics and make any adjustments. If you're in later stages, devote some time at least once a year.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Trying to Do It All Without Help</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Marketing can be a full-time job, especially if you're just learning the ropes. It's tempting to try to cut down on costs or avoid delegating to others by managing everything yourself.</p><p id=\"\">But the DIY method can be costly, both in time and money. By spending more effort on marketing, you have less to give to your clients, and you will also have less free time. It may be helpful to consider how you can outsource certain marketing tasks to better optimize your strategy.</p><p id=\"\">Outsourcing options can include hiring a:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">virtual assistant to run a social media campaign or create content</li><li id=\"\">marketing company to help with branding, logos, and a website</li><li id=\"\">copywriter for blogging or website copy</li><li id=\"\">SEO expert for increasing online presence</li><li id=\"\">public relations specialist for advertising large-scale projects and press releases</li></ul><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Having Unrealistic Expectations or Doing Too Much Too Soon</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Even the most successful marketing campaigns face problems. It's important to have reasonable expectations for your business- if you're just starting out, it's unlikely that you will build an entire caseload in just a few weeks.</p><p id=\"\">At the same time, pacing also matters. For example, if you know you want to be active on social media, it may be overwhelming to make profiles and content for four different platforms. Instead, consider focusing your effort on one platform at a time and build your audience slowly and authentically.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Inadequate Call to Action (CTA)</strong></h2><p id=\"\">No matter how you market your business, clients should easily know how to reach you. This applies whether you're handing out business cards or directing clients to your website.</p><p id=\"\">Compelling calls to action can include encouraging website visitors to sign up for your monthly newsletter, schedule an initial consultation, download a resource you created, or contact you directly.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Overpricing or Underpricing Services (Or Failing to Include Prices)</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Finances certainly come into play when potential clients are sourcing therapists. With that, it's important to establish your fees and<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/the-ultimate-guide-to-setting-fees-in-private-practice-and-what-to-avoid\" id=\"\"> price your services</a> accordingly.</p><p id=\"\">Some therapists avoid posting fees on their websites because they don't want to deter potential clients from reaching out. This is often a mistake- transparency is an essential part of the work, and the opposite may happen where more clients contact you only to be dissuaded by the price later on.</p><p id=\"\">Even though you might feel tempted to charge less than other therapists, clients might assume your lower rate indicates a lack of experience, competence, or confidence, all of which can affect their ability to trust your skillset.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts On Successful Marketing Campaigns for Therapists</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most therapists aren't taught to market their business or create successful advertising campaigns. But it's important to regularly consider how you can speak to potential clients and keep your company running smoothly. There's no \"perfect\" strategy for marketing, and it's important to keep an open mind and be willing to experiment with new techniques to find what works best for you.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we support therapists and other mental health professionals in streamlining their management software. We aim to free up your time and resources so you can focus more on what you do best- helping your clients.</p><p id=\"\">We offer inclusive software packages that integrate EMR, revenue cycle management, and our unique NavixAI™ into one effective, affordable system.

In group settings, this can also reinforce a sense of camaraderie.</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Mask making:</strong> Mask making helps with issues related to depression, poor body image, trauma, and anxiety.

These emotions are harmful if they interfere with your quality of life and hinder you from functioning normally.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What Is Anxiety?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Anxiety is a sensation of concern, tension, and worry that can manifest physically in the form of raised blood pressure and other symptoms. While some anxiety is normal and even anticipated as we negotiate life's stressors, for people suffering from an anxiety disorder, the dread and concern do not go away and can interfere with everyday tasks.</p><p id=\"\">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) occurs when a person has excessive anxiety or concern on most days for at least six months. Instead of periodic anxieties, someone with GAD suffers excessive anxiety about many aspects of their life, even items others might not consider to be concerning.</p><p id=\"\">In addition to anxiety, GAD can cause restlessness, irritation, exhaustion, and difficulties managing feelings of concern, even when sleeping.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Symptoms of Anxiety</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The following symptoms characterize anxiety disorders:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Feeling anxious</li><li id=\"\">Feeling powerless</li><li id=\"\">A sensation of impending disaster, danger, or panic</li><li id=\"\">accelerated heart rate</li><li id=\"\">Hyperventilation</li><li id=\"\">Sweating or trembling</li><li id=\"\">Obsessively considering the panic trigger</li></ul><p id=\"\">Anxiety and panic can obstruct everyday activity and be difficult to manage. They are exaggerated compared to the actual threat and might induce you to avoid locations or situations.</p><p id=\"\">You should consult a doctor if your anxiety interferes with your life and relationships. Before contacting a mental health expert, consult your provider to rule out any underlying physical health issues.</p><p id=\"\">While most people with anxiety disorders require psychotherapy or medication to regulate their anxiety, lifestyle adjustments and coping methods can also help.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ways to Deal with Anxiety Disorder&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">There are tactics you may employ if you suffer from anxiety to prevent becoming consumed by it. Here are several ways to assist you in solving the matter right away, as well as long-term answers to a reoccurring problem.</p><p id=\"\">If your anxiety is sporadic and interfering with your attention or tasks, several short natural cures may help you regain control of the issue.</p><p id=\"\">Suppose your anxiety is focused on a specific scenario, such as being concerned about an approaching event. In that case, you may observe that the symptoms are brief and generally disappear when the expected event occurs.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Examine Your Mental Process</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Negative ideas might take root in your head and alter the seriousness of the issue. One method is to confront your worries, ask whether they are genuine, and discover where you can regain control.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">2. Correct Breathing Techniques</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Hyperventilation, which increases oxygen levels and decreases carbon dioxide in the blood, can cause physical signs of anxiety. Carbon dioxide aids in modulating the body's response to anxiety and panic.</p><p id=\"\">To avoid hyperventilation, a person suffering from anxiety should learn to breathe through their diaphragm rather than their chest. The trick is to allow your tummy to expand as you breathe in.</p><p id=\"\">Place one hand on your lower tummy and the other on your chest to ensure proper breathing. Correct breathing causes your belly to move rather than your chest. It also helps to calm your breathing when you are stressed. Some people find abdominal breathing difficult. There are several more breathing strategies to try. You may also try holding your breath for a few seconds. This helps to increase blood carbon dioxide levels.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Aromatherapy</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Natural smells like lavender, chamomile, and sandalwood may be incredibly calming, whether in the form of essential oils, incense, or candles. Aromatherapy is known to help stimulate particular receptors in your brain, potentially reducing anxiety.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Exercise</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Thepsymptoms of anxiety are triggered by the 'fight-or-flight' reaction, which fills the body with adrenaline and other stress hormones. Exercise burns off stress hormones and promotes relaxation. Physical activity is another effective anxiety-reduction strategy. Aim to engage in some physical exercise at least three to four times a week, and diversify your activities to avoid monotony.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Increasing One's Self-Esteem</strong></h4><p id=\"\">People who suffer from anxiety disorders frequently have poor self-esteem. In many ways, feeling worthless may aggravate anxiety. It might cause a passive manner of engaging with people and promote a dread of being harshly criticized. Low self-esteem may also be connected to the influence of the anxiety illness on your life. These issues may include isolation, shame and guilt, depression, and difficulties functioning at school, work, or in social situations.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">6. Dietary Changes</strong></h4><p id=\"\">Magnesium helps muscular tissue relax, and a magnesium deficit can lead to anxiety, sadness, and sleeplessness. Inadequate vitamin B and calcium consumption can also increase anxiety symptoms. Consume wholegrain cereals, leafy green vegetables, and low-fat dairy products regularly.</p><p id=\"\">Nicotine, caffeine, and stimulant medicines (such as those containing caffeine) cause your adrenal glands to produce adrenaline, one of the primary stress hormones. These are best avoided. Other items to avoid include salt and other chemicals such as preservatives. Whenever possible, choose fresh, unprocessed meals.</p><h4 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">7. Medication&nbsp;</strong></h4><p id=\"\">It is critical that drugs be viewed as a temporary remedy rather than a permanent answer to anxiety problems.</p><p id=\"\">Long-term research studies have demonstrated that psychological treatments, such as cognitive behavior therapy, are far more successful than drugs in treating anxiety problems.

These notes track progress, and they enable clients using health insurance to continue receiving coverage for clinical services.</p><p id=\"\">That said, therapists often find writing notes to be tedious and overwhelming. But this often speaks to the reality that many providers are untrained when it comes to the best standards in documentation. High caseloads and complex clinical cases can also make the note process more challenging.</p><p id=\"\">Keeping appropriate, timely progress notes is an essential part of the work, and mastering this skill is imperative for both your clinical standing and your clients' overall treatment.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Understanding Therapy Progress Notes Vs. Process Notes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Therapy progress notes represent a standard form of clinical documentation. They become part of a client's official medical record, and they assist with keeping track of a client's progress. All mental health professionals are legally required to maintain such notes. Every progress note needs to adhere to a specific format that aligns with a client's specific treatment plan.</p><p id=\"\">At a minimum, progress notes include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">information about your client's history</li><li id=\"\">assessment of your client's progress</li><li id=\"\">details about your client's behavior in session</li><li id=\"\">any information related to <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\">client crises&nbsp;</a></li></ul><p id=\"\">Progress notes need to also include justification for treatment as well as how the client is responding to the treatment itself. All progress notes should be consistent and maintained within the client's record.</p><p id=\"\">These notes also communicate treatment plan information between providers, and they may include past treatments, diagnoses, clinical tests, and medication prescription information.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Psychotherapy Notes/Private Notes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">According to the health insurance portability and accountability act (HIPAA), process notes (or psychotherapy notes) are intended to document or analyze the contents of conversation occurring within a private counseling session.</p><p id=\"\">Your own private notes can be essential for remembering important details that aren't necessarily relevant to a client's symptoms, prognosis, and progress. Many therapists jot down specific names or dates to better remember key parts of a client's story. Having this memory recall is often an essential part of <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/subtle-mistakes-therapists-make-when-building-therapeutic-alliances\" id=\"\">building and maintaining rapport</a>.</p><p id=\"\">A therapist's personal notes include information related to:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">questions or reflections to discuss in supervision or consultation</li><li id=\"\">your own countertransference or reflections</li><li id=\"\">desired areas of further exploration with the client</li></ul><p id=\"\">Unlike progress notes, process notes are not mandated, and you don't have to follow any specific format when writing them. However, these notes must be kept separate from the client's file, and they should not include formal assessments or diagnoses.</p><p id=\"\">If you bill insurance, your process notes can't be audited by healthcare providers. These notes remain private, although there may be some legal cases where you must share them (i.e. you've been ordered by a judge or you're intending to prevent public safety threats).</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Best Universal Practices for Mental Health Progress Notes</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Every mental health professional uses their own discretion and nuance when they write therapy progress notes. But it's still important that documentation adheres to a certain set of standards. This ensures compliance with your own laws and ethics, but it's also in the best interest of the client. If you're using a third-party payer for services, such as an insurance company, your notes may be audited at any time.</p><p id=\"\">Failing to comply with certain requirements can result in payment clawbacks and losing the ability to panel with certain providers. From a legal standpoint, lacking adequate paperwork can result in therapists losing their licenses or being charged with negligence.</p><p id=\"\">Although there are different expectations for documentation based on the particular organization or health insurance company, some universal standards generally apply.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using an Electronic Medical Record or Electronic Health Record System for Progress Notes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Although some therapists might opt to use the old-fashioned paper-and-pen method for documentation, most people find that it's <em id=\"\">significantly </em>easier to use an electronic system. This becomes a necessity if you accept insurance or intend to provide superbills for your clients.</p><p id=\"\">These services provide HIPAA-compliant portals to store all treatment plans, progress notes, and anything else related to a client's medical history. You will also store all intake questionnaires and relevant assessments in these databases. Finally, secure portals allow you and your clients to communicate safely and in a way that still respects their protected health information.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Being Consistent and Timely With Keeping Progress Notes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">All treatment plans and notes should be completed as soon as possible. Ideally, you should finish each progress note within 24-48 hours of meeting with the client.</p><p id=\"\">If you fall behind on your documentation, make it a priority to catch up. The more time that lapses, the more likely you are to forget crucial information. Likewise, there's an increased liability if something happens to you or your client, and you don't have sufficient, up-to-date documentation about their treatment.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Updating Progress Related to the Treatment Plan</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Psychotherapy notes should be relevant to how a client is progressing according to their treatment plan. If a treatment plan needs to be revised, that should be done accordingly, and it's important to document the reasons for making such changes.</p><p id=\"\">Each progress note should also include which interventions were used and the broader context into where they fall. These interventions help substantiate the <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/goal-setting-in-therapy-empowering-client-success\" id=\"\">treatment goals</a> and measure ongoing progress.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Maintaining Confidentiality Within Notes and Progress</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Therapy inherently entails an exchange of sensitive information. With that, it's important to consider how your therapy progress notes support and maintain client confidentiality.</p><p id=\"\">This can feel like a fine line, but it may be helpful to ask yourself, \"How would my client feel if these notes were turned over via a court order?\" If you feel concerned about how you describe any information, you need to reevaluate your documentation strategy.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Avoid long-winded client quotes: </strong>Keep direct quotes to a minimum, and ensure that they are specific to treatment or safety planning. For example, \"Client reported, 'I sometimes wish I wouldn't wake up in the morning,' which promoted suicide assessment and safety planning.\"</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Avoid using emotion-laden language: </strong>Consider using clinical terms like dysphoric/euthymic/flat/blunted when describing mood and affect instead of happy/sad/angry (unless you are using a direct quote).</li><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Maintain ownership over your own observations: </strong>Use statements like, \"This writer noted,\" or \"The client reported\" to categorize who holds responsibility for a certain action or thought.</li></ul><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using a Consistent Note-Taking Format</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Whether you use SOAP notes, DAP notes, BIRP notes, or another format, consistency is key. Ensure that you use the same type of format for all your clinical notes.</p><p id=\"\">If you <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/15-tips-for-running-better-group-therapy-sessions\" id=\"\">conduct group therapy</a>, you should also follow the same note format for each group session. This keeps treatment organized and cohesive.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Documentation Mistakes to Avoid Making</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Clinical notes should be appropriate and to the point. Of course, there isn't a perfect process for writing or maintaining notes. But here are some common mental health professional documenting mistakes to avoid:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using Subjective Criteria in the Wrong Sections</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Every process note should discern subjective from objective data when it comes to a client's treatment.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Subjective data: </strong>This refers to the clinician's own opinions, interpretations, and clinical observations. For example, \"He presented as more depressed than usual,\" or, \"She appeared engaged and motivated to talk about her marriage,\" are both examples of subjective data.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Objective data: </strong>Objective data is measurable and quantifiable. This section needs to focus on any factual information supporting a client's diagnosis, physical or behavioral symptoms, appearance, orientation, and overall affect. An example of objective information includes, \"Client presented as alert, oriented to time and place, and displayed a flat affect in session. He was groomed and neatly dressed. He replied to questions promptly and maintained good eye contact.\"</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Provide Supporting Facts</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Therapy notes should not include statements lacking supportive facts. It is not enough to say, \"Client was eager to talk about her anxiety.\" You need to include relevant details that support this claim. For example, you might say, \"Client was eager to talk about her anxiety as demonstrated by her discussing a recent conflict with her spouse that evoked feelings of panic and dread.\"</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using Too Many Abbreviations or Shorthand Terms</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Always consider that someone who reviews an individual's medical record may not inherently know specific clinical terminology. When in doubt, write the full term out. Shorthand may be tempting when you're trying to save time, but unless it's obvious to all mental health professionals, keep original terms.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Include the Next Course of Action</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It's important that your notes include your intended next steps for upcoming sessions. Aim to stay aligned with the client's progress and treatment plan without reinstating what's already been written. Make sure you include items that both you and the client have agreed to do and note any potential obstacles that may impede the client's progress.</p><p id=\"\">A sufficient plan reads like, \"Client and therapist will meet for their next therapy session on July 14 at 10:00 am. Client will be attending a family counseling session with an assigned family therapist on July 10 and will review the content of this session in therapy. Client reports he will exercise 3x this week and take his new depression medication as prescribed.\"</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Using Moral Judgments</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Be mindful of using certain terms that imply bias or moral judgment, including \"good,\" \"bad,\" \"ugly,\" \"attractive,\" or other related words. While psychotherapy notes can and should include a therapist's subjective opinions, it's not your job to deem which decisions or behaviors are superior to others.</p><p id=\"\">With that, aim to also avoid using slang, poor grammar, and bad spelling. Avoid using any absolute language, including \"always\" or \"never.\" Remember that cultural sensitivity is important for all mental health progress notes. Assume that a client, at some point, could have access to their psychotherapy note.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Making Notes Too Lengthy and Detailed</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Progress notes should include enough information to paint a clear picture of a client’s progress and what occurred during the specific session. It should also outline plans for future sessions.</p><p id=\"\">That said, it's generally advised to keep points concise and matter-of-fact. Aim to be clear and definitive, but don't provide so much detail that you're including unnecessary information. It's most important that you capture the main themes of the session as well as anything that relates to treatment goal progress.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Failing to Maintain Record-Keeping Standards</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Appropriate record-keeping is a vital component of your clinical work. You're still responsible for holding onto notes after the therapy relationship ends.</p><p id=\"\">Each state typically has specific guidelines indicating how long you must hold onto therapy notes. For example, the APA recommends that therapists maintain records for at least 7 years, although some providers advise keeping them for longer, as earlier information can prove to be valuable should you resume work with a client at a much later point.</p><p id=\"\">For this reason alone, most therapists opt for electronic documentation, as it creates a simpler storage system for client files.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts on Strengthening Clinical Documentation</strong></h2><p id=\"\">All mental health practitioners should strive to improve the quality of their progress notes throughout the duration of their careers. As care becomes more integrative, and clients increasingly use third-party payers to authorize treatment, the need for accurate documentation becomes more paramount.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

They can be intimidating, time-consuming, and discouraging.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">If you’ve recently been audited, you may feel unsure about the next steps. Know that you’re not alone and that many, many healthcare providers have navigated this process. With the right mentality and strategies, you will get through this! Here’s what you need to know.</p><h2 id=\"\">Understanding Why Audits Happen</h2><p id=\"\">Insurance companies are ultimately focused on making and retaining money. They regularly audit their providers to seek payment or avoid needing to pay for future claims.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Insurance companies don’t inherently disclose their motives for auditing a provider. It’s believed that audits can be entirely random, but certain trends or t<a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/common-marketing-mistakes-therapists-often-make\" id=\"\">herapist red flags</a> may increase the likelihood of being flagged.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Abnormal billing is one of the main triggers of an insurance audit. When a provider has abnormal billing, their process and documentation distinctly differ from the other providers in their geographical region. These differences can draw attention and be a cause for targeting.</p><p id=\"\">Some examples of abnormal insurance billing include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Billing more frequent sessions than usual&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">Billing CPT codes that are unique or atypical for your specific profession</li><li id=\"\">Missing essential documentation, including initial assessments and treatment plans</li><li id=\"\">Documenting in a way that doesn’t accurately reflect the current diagnosis or treatment plan</li><li id=\"\">Failing to adhere to typical coding requirements</li><li id=\"\">Billing errors (i.e. unbilled services or confusing two different complaints)</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">What Happens During a Typical Insurance Audit?</h2><p id=\"\">Insurance audits typically start with the company withholding money from any current claims. They will also request specific documentation from you directly.</p><p id=\"\">You may be asked to provide treatment plans or notes associated with particular days of service. In rare cases, insurance company representatives may want to visit your office directly, but most companies will have you fax or mail over the information.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">If you are audited, here are the main takeaways:</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Take a few deep breaths: </strong>Despite the horror stories, if you’ve done everything right, the audit process will likely be fairly straightforward.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Adhere to the insurance company’s requests: </strong>It’s important to be cooperative and timely in sending over any requested documentation. Provide only what’s requested (sending anything extraneous may actually breach your client’s confidentiality).</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Do not change your documentation: </strong>All EHRs time-stamp treatment records, so any edits will be reflected. In other words, the insurance company will know if you revise a document at the last moment.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Always double-check your current contract: </strong>Know your own responsibilities and rights as a provider for each particular insurance network. In addition, many insurance companies have checklists for their providers about what they need.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Determine the need for an attorney: </strong>Audits can result in devastating financial consequences, particularly if you’re convicted of fraud or other related problems. Many providers feel out of their league when trying to navigate the uncharted territories of being audited. An attorney can provide you with peace of mind and reduce the risk of you making mistakes during this time.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Reduce Your Risk of Being Audited</h2><p id=\"\">It’s impossible to entirely safeguard your practice from an insurance audit. Being in-network with any payer means that they have the right to audit you at any point. That said, it’s essential to strive to maintain compliance as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Keep everything streamlined via an EMR: </strong>It’s imperative to use HIPAA-compliant practice management software to stay organized. An EMR will ensure that you stay up-to-date with all clinical notes, intake forms, treatment plans, and other essential documentation. At <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/professional\" id=\"\">Navix Health</a>, our EMR is all-inclusive and includes ongoing customer relationship management to support you at all times.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Prioritize excellent documentation: </strong>All <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\">clinical documentation </a>should be concise and professional. Ensure that your paperwork includes justification for treatment and accurately reflects client progress. Make sure you clearly know the difference between subjective and objective data when writing your notes.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Always consider medical necessity: </strong>Remember that insurance wants justifiable evidence that the client benefits from the rendered services. This should be at the forefront of your mind when writing any documentation. You want to clearly convey that stopping treatment abruptly would be problematic for your client’s well-being.</p><h2 id=\"\">Maintaining Compliance In Your Practice</h2><p id=\"\">Whether you’re a solo practitioner or run a large-scale mental health organization, compliance matters in everything that you do.

        "blog-content": "The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) has been a significant focus of healthcare reform in the United States. EMRs are digital versions of paper medical charts that have been used for generations.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) has been a significant focus of healthcare reform in the United States. EMRs are digital versions of paper medical charts that have been used for generations. They may include information regarding allergies, vaccination records, prescriptions, diagnoses,and medical histories. </p><p id=\"\">Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is essential to note that an EMR is not the same as an Electronic Health Record (EHR). An EHR is a patient's complete medical history, while an EMR frequently includes digital iterations of session notes between a physician and their patients, such as evaluation and progress notes.The treatments they received at the clinic throughout their visits are recorded in the EMR, too. The notes in an EMR can eventually become part of the patient's EHR. </p><p id=\"\">However, EHRs hold much more information than paper charts. Past medical information, vital signs, progress notes, diagnoses, prescriptions, vaccine dates, allergies, test results, and imaging reports can all be found in an EHR. It may also include other pertinent data, such as that imported from personal wellness devices,demographic information, and insurance information. </p><p id=\"\">Here are some other significant differences between EHRs and EMRs:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">EHR is a simplified exchange of up-to-date, real-time information with other providers, laboratories, etc., while EMR is not intended to be distributed outside of the specific practice.</li><li id=\"\">EHR enables a patient's medical records to follow them wherever they go, while with EMR, it's difficult to transfer patient records outside the clinic.</li><li id=\"\">EHR allows access to resources that healthcare practitioners can utilize to make decisions, while EMR is mainly used for diagnosis and treatment by healthcare professionals.</li></ul><h2 id=\"\">Benefits of EMR in Behavioral Health</h2><p id=\"\">Electronic medical records have two distinct advantages: they benefit patients and clinics alike. Here are some of them for you to consider: </p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Data Protection.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The greatest advantage of electronic records is unquestionably increased security. The majority of behavioral health EMRs are secured systems that need different passwords for each user and typically incorporate data security components.</p><p id=\"\">Accessing paper records is far simpler than breaking into an electronic system for someone who wants to commit a harmful data leak. One of the main benefits of behavioral health EMRs is that they often secure client and agency data significantly more successfully than conventional paper charts.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Conserves Space.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Storing information on charts and papers requires lots of physical space to be taken up. Their volume expands as time passes, and they need more room to store. Instead of designating a distinct location for files, you may make room in the workplace for other amenities by shifting to digitalized data storage with the help of EMRs.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sends Alerts.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Often, patients with mental health issues are drained due to their condition and may forget to take their medicines or visit the clinic for a follow-up. Clinics can send notifications and reminders using the communication features of EMR to such patients, thus bringing them to the center of the healthcare process.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Provides Clinical Summaries.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Clinical summaries are distributed to patients, which provide information on their visits, including the treatment given, medications recommended, follow-updates, and other information. Patients can retain knowledge, remember details they would have forgotten, and better comprehend what is happening by reading these summaries whenever needed. They can also ask any queries they might have.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Improved Patient Care.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Behavioral health EMRs may significantly lower medical errors. Although there are typically fewer pharmaceuticals used in mental health treatment, psychiatric medications can be potent and must be monitored for efficacy, intensity, andpotential interactions.</p><p id=\"\">Through the patient interface, a solid behavioral health EMR may include daily client status reports, detailed graphs of prescription efficacy, and automatic precautions against drug interactions. These kinds of measures protect both the patient and the therapist.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, you may use the system to prescribe for your patient, make an order for them,and check to see whether they've already received the same medication from another doctor. Furthermore, you may quickly review the patient's history at the press of a button and learn more about their medical background and allergies. The availability of such information enables the staff and the doctor to provide the patient with comprehensive, individualized, and effective treatment. In fact, EMRs have measures in place to stop potentially conflicting treatments the patient may be receiving.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Financial advantages.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Implementing electronic medical records in your business is an excellent approach to reducing overall costs. Choosing EMR systems can result in a profitable return on your financial investment. Several employees are frequently retained on staff for tasks like filing or transcription. The expense of labor may lower revenue. Most filing activities can be eliminated by EMR software or, at the very least, reduced to the point where staff hours may be cut. The technology transcribes specified notes or notations made by the doctor during a patient visit, preventing the requirement for a staff transcriptionist and lowering transcription costs. Moreover, the sped-up and effectively recorded and reported billing services, improved radiologic diagnoses, and reduced billing mistakes contribute to lesser charges. </p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Enhanced Efficiency</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Efficiency gains are frequently a key advantage of behavioral health electronic medical records.

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Healthcare is one of the top industries that has benefited from recent technological developments, and technological advancements have fueled the expansion of many other businesses. The Electronic Medical Record (EMR), Revenue Management Cycle (RMC), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are examples of such technological innovation for behavioral healthcare institutions.</p><p id=\"\">Used individually, these software systems bring about an array of benefits to organizations by streamlining, simplifying, and managing work processes easily. However, integrating the three into one system amplifies those benefits manifolds. Understanding the tense environment in behavioral healthcare organizations, Navix Hub offers CRM, RCM, and EMR integrated solutions so you can maximize productivity and patient experience at your end.</p><p id=\"\">Before exploring the benefits of this integration, let’s understand what CRM, RCM, and EMR are.&nbsp;</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">EMRs are electronic medical records that contain the usual clinical and medical information from a single provider's office. A provider's paper chart's contents, including medical history, diagnosis, prescriptions, vaccination records, allergies, test findings, and doctor's comments, are all digitally stored in an electronic medical record (EMR). Providers mostly employ them for diagnosis and treatment.</li><li id=\"\">CRM software typically aids in the gathering and management of customer contact information as well as the management of relationships with both present and future clients. The creation and maintenance of client connections is the core goal of CRM. It is the instrument that enables you to manage patient relations and guarantee their satisfaction.&nbsp;</li><li id=\"\">RCM is the method of locating, obtaining and controlling the practice's income from payers depending on the services rendered. For a healthcare practice to be financially viable and to continue offering its patients high-quality treatment, the RCM process must be effective.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id=\"\">Let’s delve into the benefits of an all-in-one system now!</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increase in revenue.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">This is the most prominent and important advantage of an integrated EMR and CRM system. A complete patient lifecycle will be produced by an EMR and CRM system working together. As a result, you can offer the greatest patient care and experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">With this wonderful experience, your medical facility's income will rise as you draw in more patients and win their loyalty. Your company will be able to develop targeted marketing efforts to reach new clients and provide a top-notch experience for everyone with the help of the integration of EMR and CRM.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reduced errors and costs.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">With non-integrated systems, the same data must be manually input over and again. This increases the chances for the data to be error-prone, increasing inefficiency. Data transmission from one software system to another can also be expensive when managing different systems, and interface mistakes are more likely to increase costs.</p><p id=\"\">However, single-point data input is made possible by integrating a CRM, EMR, and RCM into one database. For optimal accuracy, data integrity, and efficiency, the information flows smoothly from patient intake to several locations inside the process.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Automated invoice generation.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Based on the information it extracts from the EMR, an integrated system automatically produces charges for each patient. Census data is often given to the billing division in a non-integrated system and manually input into the RCM after that. Billing mistakes, such as omitting billable sessions or days of stay, are avoided via an integrated approach. Charges are automatically calculated for outpatient services depending on attendance.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Quick and simple billing checks.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">By guaranteeing that all billable items are accounted for and then actually invoiced, an EMR and RCM linked in one database eliminate missed billing opportunities and partially paid authorizations.</p><p id=\"\">The RCM receives authorization numbers from Utilization Review automatically when an EMR is wholly linked. When claims are filed, system controls make sure that authorizations that do not match admission records are reported.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Time-Saving</strong></h3><p id=\"\">A healthcare career is demanding. To give your patient the finest care possible, doctors and other healthcare professionals must pay close attention to them. Updating separate systems and patient information manually wastes a lot of time and work. But when you can easily automate these with the help of combined EMR and CRM systems, your business will develop a seamless procedure for maintaining data and following the progress of patients. The workforce can then concentrate on doing what they do best, which is delivering healthcare services, and you can both save some valuable time.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ease of Patient Billing.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">An integrated system avoids the problems arising from using several software systems regarding patient billing. Different payment methods for insurers and patients make it difficult to see a company's whole financial picture and are ineffective. These procedures are streamlined, and a fully integrated EMR and RCM remove redundant steps.</p><p id=\"\">Patient account statements are now generated automatically rather than manually from several sources.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Up-to-date information access.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The software and tool integrations provided by our all-in-one system aid in creating information collection by making it easier to gather all patient-related data in one location.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Both the EMR and CRM will immediately update whenever any customer-related information is changed in one of them. For example, the EMR will be updated to maintain track if the CRM tool indicates that the patient has missed an appointment. Similarly, the EMR and CRM will be updated to reflect any medicine doses the patient missed, allowing them to be notified appropriately.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Enhances client experience.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The income of your practice can be impacted in a variety of ways by an integrated EMR and RCM software. But the patients will also gain from this integration since content patients are more likely to stay with a doctor and make recommendations.</p><p id=\"\">If claims processing mistakes are reduced, patients are less likely to become frustrated or confused throughout the billing process. Additionally, with seamless data transfer from your EMR to your billing software, your staff can more precisely confirm reimbursement and predict patient costs. Patient estimates are an excellent way to boost patient loyalty and upfront payments.</p><p id=\"\">Your patient group benefits indirectly from the time savings that result from EMR-RCM connectivity. At the same time, your staff can concentrate more on patient satisfaction when administrative tasks are less time-consuming.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">With the increasing digitization of many aspects of our lives, new technological advances have enabled the use of software to facilitate remote treatments for behavioral health issues. These software programs provide a virtual platform for healthcare givers to interact with their patients and securely access vital patient data, such as medical history, mental health assessments, and treatment plans. This can be especially helpful for those who need regular check-ins with specialized healthcare providers. The emergence and rapid acceptance of telehealth (the use of telecommunications technologies to deliver healthcare remotely) are proof of the need for more flexible options for patients in today's world.</p><p id=\"\">At Navix Health, we create software systems that provide the necessary tools and resources to develop a customized treatment plan tailored to the clinician and patient’s needs. Our cutting-edge software allows healthcare providers to efficiently oversee and attend to various issues without the traditional requirement for face-to-face visits. This offers a hassle-free solution for accessing treatments and care.</p><p id=\"\">Indeed, the technology stands to revolutionize the way behavioral health care is delivered, improving remote patient care drastically in the following ways:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Supports People with Limited Mobility</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Digital behavioral healthcare solutions have significantly improved healthcare provision for people who have trouble getting to care facilities. The evidence of its success has been seen during the Covid-19 pandemic when <a href=\"https://www.apg.org/news/highlighting-the-success-and-importance-of-telehealth-services-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/\" id=\"\">70%</a> of the care shifted to utilizing telehealth services due to social distancing and quarantine.</p><p id=\"\">However, telehealth solutions continue to be used by organizations, even after the fight against Covid-19, owing to their benefits. Healthcare given via technology from a doctor off-site may be the future of ensuring elders, especially those who have trouble getting around, receive the healthcare when and where they need it most.</p><p id=\"\">And it’s not just elderly patients who experience mobility problems. Those with chronic diseases require regular check-ups, too. Remote access may significantly enhance the quality of life for patients who lack a dependable mode of transportation, suffer from mobility issues, or have impairments that make travel challenging.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Promotes Prompt Care</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The healthcare industry faces a significant challenge: the ability to direct patients to the appropriate care provider in a timely manner. Without a method for quickly identifying the best provider for their needs, patients may end up seeking treatment from the emergency hospital, an urgent care facility, or their primary care physician - all of which may not be the best option. Healthcare software provides more timely care in circumstances that require expediency. For instance, when someone is in danger of self-harm or is having suicidal thoughts, prompt access to telehealth services can be life-saving.</p><p id=\"\">In addition, specific criteria can be set to alert healthcare providers when a patient’s condition worsens. Moreover, the software makes it easier for clinicians to provide valuable treatment feedback to patients in real time.</p><p id=\"\">Latency in care, which can hinder physical services, is reduced by the virtual environment of telemedicine, making it quick and comfortable to follow up with patients and deliver timely treatment.</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Providing Patients with a Supportive Environment for Treatment</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Some patients choose not to receive treatment because they worry about being recognised when attending appointments or waiting in the waiting area or because they have transportation or scheduling challenges, among other issues. This can exacerbate any current mental disorder and be unpleasant, distressing, and anxiety-inducing.</p><p id=\"\">Fortunately, all of this may be prevented with behavioral health software that offers video conferencing capabilities, enabling patients to securely connect with a clinician or psychiatrist and receive care from the comfort of their homes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Thus, patients are far more likely to seek therapy, thanks to telehealth's comfort and privacy-preserving features.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Makes it Simple to follow up with Patients</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Improvements in treatment, persistence, and adherence largely depend on healthcare providers making consistent, methodical contact points.</p><p id=\"\">From an overview of patient consultations to symptom monitoring, remote care alternatives can generate a range of these touchpoints in a tailored and case-specific approach.</p><p id=\"\">For instance, treating severe chronic conditions like mood or bipolar disorders necessitates continually monitoring data to optimize medicine. Thus, connecting care teams and intuitive digital technologies can facilitate patients.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, digital symptom diaries and diagnostic instruments provided by the technology can aid doctors in making quick judgments about the required therapy, which can significantly improve treatment results and quality of life, depending on the ailment and patient type.</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Better Patient Outcomes</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Healthcare software services, like telehealth, can lower the likelihood of infection and provide care teams with the chance to evaluate patients more thoroughly.</p><p id=\"\">Patients with poor health can reduce their risk of infection from traditional healthcare-associated diseases by employing digital alternatives. Consequently, this can help patients avoid problems or future illness progression.</p><p id=\"\">Doctors may also have additional opportunities to inform patients about their course of treatment. Utilizing digital tools, magnifying scans for a close-up, or watching patients self-inject allows for flexible and direct communication, which can increase patient satisfaction.</p><p id=\"\">The chance for a doctor or member of the care team to view the patient's surroundings should also be mentioned. In a virtual visit, the healthcare provider can recognize cues in the patient's environment by visiting them in their place of residence. This enables the healthcare professional to find problems the patient might not have previously disclosed and enables an enhanced treatment strategy.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">In conclusion, improved treatment results contribute to increased user care and a desirable workplace for staff members at your hospital.</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Swift Communication and Monitoring</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Behavioral health software paradigms can help patient treatment in various ways, from providing more accurate monitoring (by using remote patient sensors and telemedicine software) to allowing for remote communication between patients and their doctors. The technology-driven data and visual analytics can help practitioner’s better track patient progress, enabling them to monitor their clients’ progress and intervene sooner if needed.</p><p id=\"\">Additionally, providers can assist patients in learning more about mental illness and how to discover other treatment providers by sending them appointment reminders, coping mechanisms, mental health resources, and information at the push of a button.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">As a result, it is simple and comfortable for mental health practitioners to stay in constant contact with and follow up with their patients, thus improving the quality of care.</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">The healthcare workplace is an ever-changing environment. It is essential to have a work environment that embraces diversity, promotes safety, and reduces potential discrimination. Unsafe workplaces can be detrimental to the success of healthcare businesses, leading to a lack of morale and productivity. Thus, ensuring a safe and diverse workplace is paramount to any organization. A workplace that fosters diversity and inclusion provides an opportunity for employees to be individuals, empowers them to reach their fullest potential, and helps different patient groups feel positive towards the organization.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Consider the innumerable people who visit clinics and hospitals each day in need of assistance. They are a cross-section of humankind, representing every race, faith, gender, and age. According to <a href=\"https://www.aapcho.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/NeedForDiversityHealthCareWorkforce.pdf\" id=\"\">research</a>, patients who identify with healthcare workers are more inclined to trust the healthcare facility. Additionally, they are better able to explain their illness, more likely to comprehend and adhere to the recommended course of therapy, and happier with their level of medical care.</p><p id=\"\">Any organization that values diversity has a staff that is made up of people of all ages, genders, colors, and sexual orientations. In other words, it describes the situation in which a healthcare facility's medical and administrative employees represent a diverse variety of backgrounds and experiences.</p><p id=\"\">Healthcare workers should be just as varied as the patients they care for, if not more so. This makes sure that everybody who enters the building will be greeted by someone who can relate to them, connect with them, and better meet their specific requirements.</p><p id=\"\">Similarly, workplace safety is an equally important component for healthcare organizations that want to run successfully in today’s world. It refers to the setting in which an organization conducts business and includes all elements that influence employees' health, safety and welfare. This guarantees low employee turnover, a culture of trust, and increased efficiency and productivity.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Among many others, a lack of workplace diversity and safety leads to the following:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Disruptions in communication.</strong></li></ul><p id=\"\">Lack of workforce diversity can result in a breakdown in communication with patients, whether due to a language barrier, philosophical differences, variances in cultural norms (and expectations), or even cultural bias. Additionally, when patients cannot adequately convey their wants to the workforce, harmful errors may happen.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Limited viewpoints</strong></li></ul><p id=\"\">Lack of diversity in the healthcare workforce industry might result in a distorted viewpoint while treating patients medically, psychologically, and socially. More crucially, it could prevent critical evaluations of a patient's diagnosis, medical background, or other socioeconomic issues that might impact their health and well-being, stifling innovation and innovative thinking.</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Psychological risks</strong>‍</li></ul><p id=\"\">Owing to a lack of workplace safety, melancholy, attention deficit disorder, inattentiveness, or neglect can rise in the workforce. Work-related stress, weariness, harassment, and violence are examples of this sort of danger. These circumstances may therefore result in low morale, decreased output and poor quality of work, as well as a higher risk of harm. According to <a href=\"https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/20307-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace-a-safety-issue\" id=\"\">experts</a>, minority workers frequently struggle with psychological safety risks brought on by stress from harassment, intimidation, poor communication, insufficient training, and job uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How can integrated software systems improve workforce diversity and safety?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Navix Hub’s integrated Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) software can prevent issues of workplace diversity and safety from rising in the following ways:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">No income disparities</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Many Revenue cycle management software ensures that all employees are paid accurately and on time. This helps eliminate any potential discrepancies in pay that could arise due to manual or intentional errors, or miscommunication, ensuring workplace equality. Additionally, in many healthcare organizations, employees are paid differently based on their differences, even if they have worked the same amount as their counterparts. RCM systems can help ensure that all employees working on the same level are paid the same rate for the same amount of work, regardless of their gender or ethnicity.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Inclusive workforce</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Issues of mental health in black people have been on the rise. According to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/08/18/health/black-babies-mortality-rate-doctors-study-wellness-scli-intl/index.html\" id=\"\">studies</a>, when handled by black healthcare professionals, black people experience superior outcomes. The administration of telemedicine services to patients online is made simple by CRM systems. Many patients of color now opt for telemedicine services that can connect them with a healthcare provider of their background. Thus, this demand created by CRM for diverse providers opens the doors for healthcare organizations to include them in their workforce.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reduction in stress</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In the highly stressful environment of behavioral healthcare organizations, it is important for institutions to reduce the workload on their employees as much as possible. The integration of CRM, RCM, and EMR systems can greatly help do so by streamlining time-taking and stressful processes into one place. This way, employees don't have to switch from one platform to another, log in to different portals to retrieve information on the same patient or worry about keeping patients' records safe and sound. Additionally, this integration can help to provide better customer feedback, allowing team members to identify any potential safety issues before they become a problem. Prevention of such cases can reduce employee stress levels, keeping them from psychological hazards.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Improved communication among employees</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In non-diverse workplaces, communication undergoes various hurdles. It is not transparent or smooth. Employees may choose not to communicate with others based on gender, race, age, etc. By providing a centralized customer information database, Navix Hubs integrated software can help reduce the potential for such disrupted communication and misunderstandings between team members. The flow of information is tied together seamlessly, leaving no room for such non-inclusive issues to occur. This can aid in ensuring that all team members work together towards a common goal, leading to improved safety and diversity in the workplace.</p><p id=\"\">Overall, taking the right steps to reduce burden, pressure, and discrimination in the workplace can help protect your employees from psychological risks while reducing employee turnover and absences. This can in turn lead to an increase in organizational growth and improved patient outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

Digital technologies have the ability to enhance interactions between patients and doctors and boost the efficiency of behavioral health integration.</p><p id=\"\">In recent years, the use of software to provide additional support in mental health treatment has seen a sharp increase in popularity. Several studies have shown that behavioral health software can effectively enhance patient mental health care and well-being. For example, an <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29215315/\" id=\"\">evaluation</a> of the efficacy of online and in-person treatment for depression and several forms of anxiety, including social anxiety, was published in 2018. The study focused on a specific form of therapy called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), in which clients learn to alter their negative emotions by transforming how they perceive issues, anxieties, and experiences. The researchers collated the results of 20 investigations, including more than 1,400 treatment participants.

Our mission is to revolutionize mental healthcare so you and your patients can easily benefit from high-quality care.</p><p id=\"\">However, achieving success in mental health treatment requires an intimate knowledge of how a software system tailored to deliver mental health services can improve outcomes. Such a system has the potential to bring a host of benefits, including the following:&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reducing feelings of loneliness.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Software systems can come embedded with mental health chatbot features to provide patients who feel lonely with a companion to talk to. For many mental health patients, the idea of discussing an issue with another person is a barrier in and of itself. Chatbots can offer a sympathetic ear, a place to voice problems and intrusive thoughts or participate in \"therapeutic\" chit-conversation. Healthcare chatbots complement patient care since they may be available round-the-clock, day and night. By asking users questions, they gather vital information that is kept for the future use of healthcare practitioners when needed.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Virtual support group meetings.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Addiction to substances or self-harm is a common bad habit that goes hand in hand with mental illness. Online group meetings can function as confidential gatherings. It promotes growth, ideas, and consequences that an individual is experiencing while preserving identity. Providers can use online group sessions using video conferencing technologies, websites that provide anonymity, and other methods. The entire group of your patients may participate electronically and communicate about their healing journeys and opinions. A medical expert can run the meetings and offer active counseling and support.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Providing treatments over the phone.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Instead of requiring constant monitoring, the patient can gain access to numerous cognitive and behavioral therapies online. During your care, you can post daily advice and manuals onto the patient’s phone for them to access and use. And instead of a physical session, you can email the patient videos, links, and other materials. This way, patients can also learn to manage their symptoms and conditions themselves.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tackling stigma with mental health.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The advancement of technology has given rise to innovative measures to tackle mental health issues and promote the well-being of individuals. Digital innovation has the potential to enhance accessibility and reduce stigma among mental health patients by providing them with a safe space for communication without the fear of judgment. They don't have to wait in waiting lines, hoping nobody they know spots them there, which could further exacerbate their anxiety. Online therapy options have become increasingly popular, making it easier for patients to find help at their own convenience. Services such as remote teletherapy and self-care mobile applications can provide individuals with tools to develop resilience and manage their conditions from the comfort of their homes.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increasing effectiveness.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">To assist patients with mental health issues, there are several courses of action to take, depending upon each patient's need and stage of mental health. For some, online education and self-care programs may be adequate to help manage symptoms without requiring medical aid, while for others, there may be a need for more extensive treatments. Telepsychiatry offers a more flexible way to communicate with a mental health specialist in a face-to-face manner, which may enable faster recognition of issues that require emergency care, thus giving doctors more time to devote to those in dire need of their help.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Increasing access to care for all.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Technological solutions have proved to be invaluable in helping decrease mental health disparities, particularly among minority groups. By providing access to remote therapy, telemedicine allows people who may not otherwise have access to critical mental health resources to get the help they require and deserve. Additionally, the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning allow healthcare professionals to develop personalized treatments quickly and accurately. With the reduced time and cost associated with these services, more minority individuals can now access mental health support.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, the software can provide those belonging to minority groups the opportunity to connect with healthcare providers from their own backgrounds online. This can make them feel less judged and more open to speaking their minds, which is extremely important for mental health treatment success.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Tracking the progress of the patient online.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Utilizing digital paths and tools, you can easily get a full grasp of a patient's development and health condition. You can launch surveys on your mobile application, and the patient can respond to them. This could be an excellent way to assess the efficacy of your interventions and alter your practices accordingly. Furthermore, you can use various methods to monitor your client's progress which can also help you track patient progress and identify early warning signs of deterioration.</p>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Do you long for the fervor and enthusiasm you experienced at the beginning of your medical career? You were getting to know your patients and enjoying the opportunity to help them with their medical problems. But all of it is gone today, replaced by a lack of enjoyment, mental tiredness, motivation, and interest in anything else. Burnout, a mental illness that appears as a chronic reaction to ongoing job stress, is what you are going through right now.</p><p id=\"\">Clinician burnout has unfortunately increased at an unpleasant rate in recent years, particularly following COVID-19. According to a Mayo Clinic survey, nearly 62 percent of doctors in the US said they felt burned out in 2021. This is a serious issue since it doesn't go away on its own. Instead, it can only worsen if you address the underlying issues immediately. Your mental and emotional well-being might decline even further, making it difficult for you to perform your job duties satisfactorily. These problems might affect your relationships and other facets of your life.</p><p id=\"\">The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) predicted that the demand for physicians will continue to outpace the supply for the third consecutive year, resulting in a projected overall physician shortage that will reach <a href=\"https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/healthcare/physician-shortage-could-hit-over-40-100k-by-2030\" id=\"\">34,600 to 88,000</a> doctors in 2025 and continue to expand dramatically by 2030. This means the burden on the existing clinicians will remain unmanageable in the future.</p><p id=\"\">Although behavioral health software has become increasingly popular over the past few years, it’s still not as common a practice as it should be.</p><p id=\"\">Hence, there is a pressing need for digitized practices to be adopted across the industry. This will enable clinicians to feel less pressured and meet the rising demand for healthcare services more efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">To realize the necessity of employing behavioral healthcare software in today’s world, it's crucial to comprehend the advantages it brings. Here are a few of them:<strong id=\"\">‍</strong></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Eases common struggles associated with clinician burnout.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Behavioral healthcare software can be a powerful ally for clinicians, streamlining administrative processes and helping to reduce the paperwork and record-keeping errors that keep them from focusing more of their time on patient care. This can help to reduce stress and improve the job satisfaction of healthcare professionals, freeing them up to better care for their patients.</p><h3 id=\"\">‍<strong id=\"\">Automated features.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Many of these systems offer features such as automated scheduling and communication tools that allow clinicians to stay organized and connected with their patients. Furthermore, they can automate specific clinical tasks, such as reminders for appointments or notifications for overdue documents, which are an added source of stress for clinicians. Additionally, automated features and analytics can help clinicians identify trends and potentially even predict problems before they arise, providing better care while cutting down on burnout.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Better patient care.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Behavioral health software can help with clinician burnout by providing clinicians with the necessary tools to track patient progress and streamline documentation. This enables clinicians to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients. Additionally, the software can help reduce the amount of communication and record-keeping errors. With these tools, clinicians can better organize their patient information, prioritize patient care, and access resources to help them make informed decisions.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Better work-life balance.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Working as a clinician can be a daunting and time-consuming responsibility. But with the help of digitized systems, doctors can take back some of the precious hours they would otherwise have to devote to their duties. They can utilize this newfound time to enjoy the company of their family and take a break from the stress - giving them the necessary time to recharge and refresh, which is vital to prevent burnout again in the future.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Better Prescription</strong>.</h3><p id=\"\">Healthcare software can be a valuable asset for mental health professionals, allowing them to provide more accurate medication prescriptions for their patients. The program can collect information about the individual's condition, analyze it, and suggest potential medication alternatives. This not only assists in simplifying the prescription process but also enables mental health professionals to stay up-to-date with the types of medications available to treat the various ailments their patients may be suffering.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Ensured patient safety.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">In the behavioral healthcare industry, keeping patient records safe is one of the topmost concerns for clinicians. Doctors working in the mental health sector have the sacred duty of protecting their patients' valuable information, which they have been trusted with.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Since physical data copies are not that secure, they could get misplaced, lost, accidentally destroyed, changed, etc. This means clinicians have to be extra careful when handling such data, which adds to their stress.</p><p id=\"\">However, using a mental health software system enables you to safeguard patient information from any mishap. The patient records are behind a login-based access mechanism in the cloud, encrypted, backed up, and only accessible by certain staff members with a controlled level of access allowed to each. So, the only people with access to patient data are licensed healthcare providers.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Battling Clinician Burnout with Navix Hub.</strong></h3><p id=\"\">The world of behavioral healthcare solutions is full of options, so why choose Navix Health?</p><p id=\"\">The answer is simple; there is nothing better than solutions for behavioral health professionals designed by other behavioral health professionals.

        "blog-content": "Research shows that about 20% of clients drop out of therapy prematurely. This statistic stands regardless of a therapist’s specific interventions or theoretical approach. And while no therapist can perfectly meet every client’s need, it’s important to pay attention if your retention rates concern you.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Research shows that about 20% of clients <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6313227/#:~:text=Research%20including%20almost%2084%2C000%20adult,%2C%20cognitive%E2%80%90behavioral%2C%20humanistic%20or\" id=\"\">drop out of therapy prematurely</a>. </p><p id=\"\">People end therapy for many reasons, some of which are not a therapist’s fault. And while no therapist can perfectly meet every client’s need, it’s important to pay attention if your retention rates concern you.</p><h2 id=\"\">Understanding Why Clients Stop Going to Therapy</h2><p id=\"\">Clients sometimes stop going to therapy for obvious reasons, and they will explicitly tell you their reasons for ending care. But, in many cases, clients simply stop showing up and may resort to ghosting instead of addressing why they’re discontinuing treatment. With that in mind, here are some of the most common reasons clients drop out prematurely:&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Incompatibility: </strong>Therapy is a relationship, and a mismatch in personalities can certainly affect a client’s willingness to engage in treatment. Ultimately, a client has the right to determine what works best for them, and if they don’t resonate with a certain approach, they may look elsewhere or stop therapy.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Financial reasons: </strong>Money is one of the more straightforward barriers affecting a client’s decision to continue therapy. However, when finances feel tight, people often scan through their budgets to determine which products and services they can cut. Therapy may not make the chopping block.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Relocation: </strong>&nbsp;A client moving makes for a natural termination. However, in the changing landscape of telehealth, some clients may choose to continue meeting with their therapist virtually. But if you met in person in the past, they may seek to work with another in-person provider.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Therapeutic rupture: </strong>It’s estimated that 20-50% of individuals and couples experience a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK571451/\" id=\"\">significant therapeutic rupture</a> during their treatment. Ruptures can happen for many reasons, but it speaks to when a client feels misunderstood, judged, or negatively perceived by their therapist. Some therapists are aware of these ruptures, but others are not, as it may require the client to come forward and acknowledge their feelings.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Sense of stagnation: </strong>Some clients drop out of therapy because they don’t feel like things are getting better. They may feel like going to sessions is a waste of time, money, or both. Even if they “like” you, this may not translate to them wanting to continue services.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Regression: </strong>Relapses or moments of regression can also coincide with dropping out of treatment. When these moments happen, clients may worry about disappointing their therapists. Or, they might feel that therapy was not helpful enough to prevent them from having such a setback.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Certain presenting issues: </strong>Some clients may be more apprehensive or resistant to therapy approaches. For example, it’s well-documented that clients with active substance use disorders, eating disorders, or personality disorders have higher drop-out rates(2). A therapist should never assume premature termination, but they should be aware of these potential risks.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Unrealistic expectations: </strong>Some clients come to therapy seeking rapid transformation. Other times, they want their therapist to give them advice or essentially make the changes for them. Once the reality of therapy sets in, they may feel disheartened and quit prematurely.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"\">What Is Considered Good Retention For Therapists?</h2><p id=\"\">It’s important to note that measuring retention isn’t always a quantifiable process. Many mental health professionals argue about how to define or even concretize what retention means within this profession.</p><p id=\"\">With that, a therapist’s workplace setting, population, and theoretical orientation must all be considered when assessing retention rates. For example, someone who specializes in solution-focused therapy for work-related stress will likely have shorter treatment episodes than someone who specializes in psychodynamic therapy for chronic, developmental trauma. In addition, a therapist who operates a cash-pay private practice will likely have drastically different retention rates from a therapist who exclusively works with mandated clients.</p><p id=\"\">Some therapists simplify their client retention rate as the mean difference between the number of sessions recommended to a client versus the actual number of sessions they attend. For example, if you estimate that a client will benefit from six months of treatment, do they stay in your care for the duration of those six months?</p><p id=\"\">That said, the nuance matters, and it needs to be addressed. Life circumstances change, and as the treatment unfolds, you may believe your client needs more (or fewer) sessions than either of you originally anticipated. This can complicate retention rates, especially if the client wants to adhere to their original plan or feels they no longer benefit from such services.</p><p id=\"\">In all of this, it is important to ask yourself the following questions:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">Do most of my clients come back after their first appointment?</li><li id=\"\">Do clients plan out terminations with me in advance?</li><li id=\"\">Do I feel like I generally have a good rapport with most of my clients?</li><li id=\"\">Do my clients come to therapy consistently?</li></ul><p id=\"\">Answering no to any of these questions may mean you have problems with retention. The most important part of considering retention is reflecting on main patterns rather than one-offs. If you have patterns of clients quitting prematurely, mistrusting you, or being flaky with their treatment, it may be a sign you need to improve how you practice.</p><h2 id=\"\">How to Improve Your Therapy Practice Retention Rates</h2><p id=\"\">Therapists should always strive to strengthen their craft, no matter how much experience or confidence they have in their work. Improving retention is just one angle of shaping expertise. Here are some considerations to keep in mind.</p><h3 id=\"\">Always Make a Good First Impression</h3><p id=\"\">Retention starts before a client ever walks into your office. When someone reaches out, aim to respond to their inquiry promptly and professionally. Invite them to schedule a consultation call with you, and if they don’t reach out, consider kindly following up to see if they are interested in moving forward.</p><p id=\"\">Before you have your first session, ensure that you have read all the paperwork ahead of time. Take a moment to look at your office and consider how the client might feel when they sit down with you. Clear out any clutter, and make sure the temperature is comfortable.</p><h3 id=\"\">Don’t Overlook the Process of Building Rapport</h3><p id=\"\">Many therapists act like rapport is simply an item to cross off on their professional checklist. But research consistently shows that the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/11/ce-corner-relationships\" id=\"\">therapeutic relationship</a> is one of the most important predictors of treatment success. Your presence matters, and clients want to feel safe and connected to their providers.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Rapport is an ongoing process, and it is never fully actualized. The more you can focus on slowing down and truly listening and connecting with your clients, the greater the sense of safety you emulate.</p><h3 id=\"\">State Your Boundaries Clearly</h3><p id=\"\">Clients like to know what they can reliably expect from their treatment. This is why establishing clear limits is so important. Boundaries shouldn’t just be outlined in your informed consent- they should be restated and reinforced whenever potential issues arise.</p><p id=\"\">Keep in mind that upholding certain boundaries may affect your retention. For example, someone might drop out if you charge them for canceling their session at the last moment. But in the long run, most therapists find that maintaining boundaries maintains a sense of consistency among their clients.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Be Mindful of Self-Disclosure</h3><p id=\"\">While self-disclosure certainly can have its place within the therapy session, it’s important to avoid making therapy about yourself. If a client senses that you want their support or validation, that can put them in an uncomfortable position. Similarly, sharing too much may cause clients to question your competence.</p><p id=\"\">Remember that you should consider <em id=\"\">why </em>you’re disclosing personal information before you actually do so. If you feel uncertain, it’s a good idea to seek consultation or supervision.</p><h3 id=\"\">Truly Identify Your Niche</h3><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">&nbsp;</strong>No therapist can help everyone, but providers with excellent retention rates strive to work with clients that truly align with their expertise. They specialize in a certain population or modality and they center their practice around that group of people (even if it’s fairly narrow).</p><p id=\"\">Not only is it unethical to treat clients out of your scope of competence, but most clients can sense when their providers lack the skill set to truly help them. Remember that it’s okay to refer out and that doing so will likely improve your retention rates.</p><p id=\"\">If you’re struggling to identify your niche, think about the clients that most excite you. What are their main issues or needs? What kind of support are they looking for? Even if your mind changes later, this may be your starting point for developing your specialty.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Pay Attention to All Feedback</h3><p id=\"\">If you do receive any constructive feedback from colleagues or clients, reflect on it. It’s especially important to note any trends. While feedback can be uncomfortable, integrating it is one of the best ways therapists can grow.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, consider asking clients for feedback directly before or after sessions. You can either send structured forms or informally ask, “What are your takeaways from today?” or “What was most helpful for you last week?”</p><h3 id=\"\">Prepare Well For Your Sessions</h3><p id=\"\">While therapy can entail relying on your intuition and trusting the here and now, successful therapists prepare for sessions accordingly. It shouldn’t feel like you’re just winging your career- that’s disingenuous to your clients.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">You should always have goals that you’re working toward. You should also think about rereading notes before meeting with clients to remember what was referenced in previous sessions. Finally, if you feel stuck on a certain issue, seek external support from a supervisor or colleague. In other words, make it a priority to come ready to work.</p><h3 id=\"\">Strive to Repair Ruptures Effectively</h3><p id=\"\">Ruptures can erode trust and safety quickly. If you note that a client may be upset with you, it’s important to address the situation. Remember that apologizing can be one of the most genuine reactions you offer. While it’s permissible to make a mistake, it’s far more important that you know how to hold yourself accountable.</p><p id=\"\">While ruptures can be uncomfortable, it can be healing for clients to receive corrective emotional experiences from their therapists. Sometimes, the main part of resolving a rupture is responding differently than the client expected (or differently than people did in the past).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=\"\">Revisit Treatment Goals</h3><p id=\"\">Clients want to know that they’re on track and making progress. Every therapist needs to make treatment plans and update them regularly. It’s also helpful to collaborate with your clients to review how they feel about their treatment. Are they satisfied with their progress? What goals do they want to revise?&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">While not all clients drop out when things feel stagnant, many do. Therapy is a service that requires significant time and money. If someone doesn’t feel like they’re truly getting something out of the work, they’ll be less inclined to participate.</p><h2 id=\"\">Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2><p id=\"\">While retention rates can be difficult to measure, you should generally feel like clients enjoy coming to you and that your caseload is fairly consistent. If that isn’t the case, it may be time to revisit the basics: rapport, warmth, safety, and good boundaries. These make for the heart of good therapy, and they’re also the heart of client retention.&nbsp;</p>",

        "blog-content": "Some people are unaware that their usual activities are harmful to their mental health. Identifying specific activities that have a negative influence on your mental health can make a significant difference in your overall well-being.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">Mental health has been elevated to the forefront of contemporary debate because it is increasingly recognized as an important component of general well-being. Even, many people do not take the necessary steps to promote their mental health and even engage in everyday activities that harm it.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Some people are unaware that their usual activities are harmful to their mental health; therefore, they continue to engage in them. Identifying specific activities in your life that have a negative influence on your mental health can make a significant difference in your overall well-being. Then you may start living your life to the fullest. These are frequent poor behaviours that harm your mental health.</p><p id=\"\">Below are the habits that are affecting your mental health:</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">1. Too Much Time on Social MediaSpending&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Social networking is a great way to stay in touch with friends, read the news, and find humorous videos. These may appear to be beneficial, but there is a darker side to social media that you may be unaware of. Many people who use social media on a regular basis find themselves comparing their lives to those of others. It's easy to compare yourself to others because photographs and status update merely reveals a snippet of people's life. It is no surprise that someone may appear to have a flawless life with filters and other tools. These comparisons can lead to emotions of despair and worry.</p><p id=\"\">However, keep in mind that social media can only display so much. People will not publish their lowest moments but rather their proudest ones. This might make it easy to compare yourself to others and hold jealousy, causing you to lose out on benefits like bonding with friends. Reducing your time spent on social media will help you break the habit and live a better life.</p><h3 id=\"\">2. <strong id=\"\">Keeping Anger and Other Strong Emotions at Bay</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Do you take pride in your ability to internalize your feelings and have a positive attitude in every situation? While it is frequently vital to keep your cool when things become tough, research suggests that repressing emotions, particularly anger, can be harmful to your mental health. Neglecting your emotional needs might make it harder to say no, set boundaries, and develop healthy relationships. And, over time, repressing your rage turns you into a ticking time bomb that may be triggered by the tiniest annoyance.</p><p id=\"\">You don't want to be the person shouting at the cashier because they won't accept your expired coupon, but you also don't want to be biting your tongue all the time. It is critical to find a happy medium with your rage. Remember that anger is not an issue if it is managed appropriately.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">3. Not Getting Enough Sleep</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Staying up late watching your favorite TV show is a fantastic idea on a weekend night, but not every day. Sleep is essential for mental and physical health because it allows your body and mind to rest. Sleep deprivation may have an impact on your mood, energy levels, motivation, and mental health. You are more prone to suffer from sadness and anxiety if you are sleep deprived, which can lead to even greater sleep deprivation.</p><p id=\"\">Set a firm sleep plan to follow, especially on weekends, to prevent slipping into this habit. Creating a sleep routine can guarantee you get adequate sleep and keep your body on track so you can get the most out of your slumber.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">4. Junk Food Eating</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Everyone enjoys a good bag of chips or a delicious chocolate chip cookie, and while it's not wrong to enjoy these on occasion, you shouldn't eat them every day. Some people consume extremely unhealthy meals, which can have a substantial influence on their mental health. Eating foods high in sugar and fat or that are highly processed can wreak havoc on your mental health, causing anxiety and depression symptoms.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">5. Addiction to Drugs</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Drugs and alcohol are addictive, but they are often used as a quick fix for stress and despair, as well as an escape from reality; they have several long-term effects on both physical and mental health. Abusing drugs is never a good habit. Seek help if you are stressed, and consider using recreational drugs to relieve your anxiety.<strong id=\"\">‍</strong></p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">6. Too Much Time Spent Inside</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It's understandable to want to stay inside after a global pandemic to protect yourself and others. Getting your daily dose of fresh air, on the other hand, is critical to maintaining good mental health. Breathing in the fresh air and feeling the sun on your skin is beneficial to your mental health. Staying indoors can keep you in the dark for long periods of time, which can have a negative impact on your mental health and cause depression symptoms.</p><p id=\"\">Getting out of the house safely can help you feel better and sleep better. You may also be experiencing depression symptoms as a result of a vitamin D deficiency caused by spending too much time indoors. Going outside will assist you in combating this as well as improving your general health.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">7. Procrastinating</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Many people struggle to deal with this issue, which is sadly due to a lack of motivation. Waiting it out by turning to other \"less important\" activities as escapism for your anxiety, such as watching YouTube videos, can actually make things worse, as it may pressure you into worrying about your work, which leads to stress. If you have the will to accomplish it, do it now.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Conclusion</strong></h3><p id=\"\">There are numerous daily habits that people engage in that have a significant impact on their mental health. In fact, some of your favorite hobbies and habits may be causing your mental health to deteriorate. Examining your daily routines can help you identify which practices may be harming your mental health rather than helping it. From there, you may start replacing unhealthy habits with healthier ones that are better for your mental health.</p><p id=\"\">Our mental health can easily fall through the cracks throughout our regular activities. Improving your mental health takes time and effort, but there is no better time to begin than now. Whether you want to modify a few habits or go deep into your mental health journey, breaking these bad habits can put you on the right track.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p><h3 id=\"\">‍</h3><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\"> </strong></h3>",

        "content": "<p id=\"\">Group therapy offers the benefit of professional guidance with peer-based camaraderie and emotional support. Groups can augment the work done individually. And in some settings, group therapy can be even more beneficial than individual treatment. </p><h2 id=\"\">Always Discuss and Reinforce the Rules </h2><p id=\"\">In all forms of group psychotherapy, it’s important to maintain a consistent level of predictability. Having ground rules in place- and reminding members of them- offers a sense of ongoing structure. This becomes especially important if you facilitate open groups where new members are constantly being integrated into the dynamic.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Discuss confidentiality:</strong> Briefly remind group members of confidentiality limits. Identify yourself as a mandated reporter and explain what that entails. While you can’t ensure that members keep the information confidential, mention the benefits of doing so. When clients respect the integrity of their group, they're more inclined to respect confidentiality.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Reinforce ongoing respect:</strong> Each group member should feel that the group is safe, supportive, and inclusive. It's essential that you're able to model addressing inappropriate behavior and handling it effectively.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Encourage group members to give feedback on group rules</strong>: It can be helpful to make group rules a collaborative process, particularly if you facilitate closed groups with higher levels of engagement. From this approach, members play an instrumental role in creating effective group dynamics.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Restate the group objective:</strong> Every group therapy session should have an objective, whether it's learning a new skill, practicing new techniques, or exploring difficult emotions. It can be helpful to remind group members of this objective when you begin the group.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Never force group treatment participation:</strong> Group work provides a unique therapeutic process, but members should never feel pressured or ashamed to speak. Some people arrive to groups after a complex history of unhelpful or traumatic group sessions. Many might also have poor socialization techniques, making it difficult to feel safe within therapy groups.</p><h2 id=\"\">Pay Attention to Group Cohesion</h2><p id=\"\">Group cohesion refers to how group members connect to the group individually and as a whole. Sometimes, based on the group's purpose, this happens easily. But other times, group cohesiveness poses challenges.</p><p id=\"\">One of the benefits of group therapy is working with resistance and discomfort in the here and now. As much as possible, encourage members to connect group members on their shared experiences rather than their differences. Within that, groups provide a rich experience for building social support and deepening emotional intimacy.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Encourage clients to give feedback to one another:</strong> Unless you're running a psychoeducational group, most groups should be collaborative. Successful group treatment means members of the group are engaging with one another- it shouldn't just be you speaking to the crowd as an expert. Over time, members of the group should willingly step in to address problems when they arise.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Identify how other group members relate to each other: </strong>Make a note of how certain members react in the here and now. You may choose to address these nonverbal or verbal patterns based on the context of the group. But even if you don't, knowing where group members stand with one another is an important part of monitoring overall cohesiveness.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Always address ruptures:</strong> Ruptures within a group setting are inevitable, but a successful therapy group can grow and become even stronger after a rupture. That said, it's your job to model being comfortable addressing the tension. Give group participants the opportunity to express themselves and consider if individual group members might need attention after the group.</p><h2 id=\"\">Solicit Ongoing Feedback</h2><p id=\"\">Measuring a successful group therapy session isn't always obvious, so it's helpful to encourage clients to provide feedback on what is and isn't working. Some therapists achieve this by giving brief assessments after each group session or treatment episode. These can be effective for your own training purposes.</p><p id=\"\">Group facilitation requires ongoing self-reflection, and it's helpful for practicing therapists to seek feedback from other professionals. This is where supervision, consultation, and your own therapy can be paramount for professional development.</p><h2 id=\"\">Commit to Developing Strong Group Therapy Techniques</h2><p id=\"\">Mastering the craft of group therapy starts with identifying what you most want to achieve in a particular group. In a support group, for instance, the goal might be for members to strengthen the level of connection they feel with others over a specific issue. In a relapse prevention goal, the goal would be to empower members to use specific tools to avoid a relapse.</p><p id=\"\">Having this goal at the forefront of your work- starting from that first group session- will help you develop various group therapy activities.</p><h3 id=\"\">Curriculum Vs Your Own Group</h3><p id=\"\">Following an evidence-based group curriculum provides a sense of ongoing structure for your group. Likewise, these types of groups may be required in certain settings. The main benefit is that these groups have been developed, tested, and demonstrated as effective. You also don't have to come up with your own group activities or schedule,</p><p id=\"\">That said, many therapists value the flexibility of creating their own group curriculum. Having your own group activities can be advantageous, especially if your group combines elements of several different theoretical orientations.</p><h3 id=\"\">Encourage Creative Expression</h3><p id=\"\">In all group discussions, creative expression offers group members a chance to be vulnerable even if talking about their feelings directly feels uncomfortable.</p><p id=\"\">Creative expression is multifaceted, but it may include:</p><ul id=\"\"><li id=\"\">drawing and painting activities</li><li id=\"\">writing assignments</li><li id=\"\">collaging</li><li id=\"\">psychodrama and other experiential exercises</li><li id=\"\">music, song, and dance</li></ul><h3 id=\"\">Have Group Members Bring In Their Own Topics</h3><p id=\"\">Group settings can feel more collaborative when a group therapist encourages members to come to groups prepared with topics and activities. This is also empowering for group members, as they can focus on what feels most important to them.</p><p id=\"\">You may also consider assigning various group members to act as leaders within the group. From this framework, each member shares responsibility for bringing valuable insights into the overall dynamic.</p><h2 id=\"\">Final Thoughts On How to Run Group Therapy</h2><p id=\"\">Group therapy offers a unique approach toward strengthening peer connection and symptom relief. Successful group therapy is a collaborative effort, but the group facilitator ultimately sets the stage for building safety and connection.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

        "blog-content": "If you’re debating expanding your current practice into a group practice, it’s important to ask yourself these essential questions.",
        "content": "<p id=\"\">At some point, most successful private practice therapists will either ask themselves, “Should I start a group practice?” or another associate or therapist will ask them if they’re hiring.</p><p id=\"\">Group practices can be appealing for many reasons. You can scale your business, earn more income, help more clients, and mentor other clinicians. But there are equally-important downsides to consider, such as operating costs, managing others, and being responsible for more things going wrong.</p><p id=\"\">If you’re debating expanding your current practice into a group practice, it’s important to ask yourself these essential questions.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Why Should I Start a Group Practice?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">No therapist should just open a group practice arbitrarily or haphazardly. Expanding your business requires a significant investment in your time, energy, and financial resources. There can be a lot at stake, and you really need to reflect on your intentions before you make a move.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">Start by considering what’s compelling you <em id=\"\">right now </em>to make this business choice. What are you hoping to achieve? And what will you tell yourself to stay motivated even when things become undoubtedly challenging? Even if you don’t have exact answers, it’s important to be aware of your main values at this time.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Will I Hire Therapists for My Group Practice?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Not only do you need clients for your group therapy practice, but you also need strategies in place for hiring the right therapists. New owners are often surprised by how difficult it can be to source, onboard, and hold onto their clinical team.</p><p id=\"\">You have to consider that your more successful therapists might move onto their own solo practice. This is one of the \"costs\" of doing business, but it can be challenging and, at times, disheartening.</p><p id=\"\">At the same time, while therapists may be used to setting boundaries with their clients, they may feel uncomfortable doing so with their therapists. But you will likely encounter staff who fail to perform or complete certain expectations in a timely or appropriate manner. Knowing how to manage these problems requires skill, and it can take time to build that skill.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, you want to maintain a good reputation within the community. Therapists should <em id=\"\">want </em>to work with you. A poor image, even if it's unfounded, can significantly impact your hiring process.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Do I Like Managing People?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">It's important to remember that great therapists don't always make for great managers or business leaders. In fact, this is an area where many mental health professionals struggle.</p><p id=\"\">A group practice owner, however, needs to prioritize strong communication, boundaries, and onboarding practices. This makes your work much different than a solo private practice. At any given moment, you might be training staff or outlining consequences if they don't follow through with certain tasks, such as <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/clinical-notes-top-therapy-documentation-mistakes-to-avoid-making\" id=\"\">completing paperwork on time</a>.</p><p id=\"\">If you enjoy this kind of leadership, scaling your solo practice into a group one can be highly rewarding. But if this is intimidating or uncomfortable to you, you might find it difficult to adjust to this business model.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">What’s My Business Plan?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Even though they may seem like an old-fashioned concept, business plans are essential for organizing ideas and launching a new company. A successful group practice has a clear executive summary, company description, market analysis, and information and marketing and sales.</p><p id=\"\">Your business plan will likely evolve, but you should really consider making a comprehensive one before taking the leap in expanding your own practice. Having a solid plan will help you with everything from staying on track to hiring new staff to advertising your practice.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Will My Group Practice Accept Insurance?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">How you accept payment is a significant part of shaping your group practice. Many group practice owners opt to accept insurance, but that requires managing insurance and client billing. It may also mean less profit for both you and your therapists, which can lead to financial problems.</p><p id=\"\">However, <em id=\"\">not </em>taking insurance has its own considerations. Where insurance often acts as a steady source of referrals, a self-pay, cash-only group private practice needs to have solid and consistent marketing. People in the community need to know your presence,</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Will My Therapists Be Classified?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Each state has its own laws about classifying therapists. You need to be aware of what your state's requirements are in assigning independent contractors from employees.</p><p id=\"\">A 1099 contractor (or independent contractor) has their own business. You are limited in how you schedule them or which tasks you require them to do. Contracted providers typically cost more per hour, although they generally cost the business less over the course of a month or year (because you don't provide them with benefits).</p><p id=\"\">Employee providers typically adhere to a specific schedule and salary or hourly rate. You are also responsible for providing them with workplace benefits and health insurance. The employment system you use can also affect your EHR structure, as employees will typically work under your group practice, whereas contractors will often have their own accounts.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Am I Looking To Make Passive Income With a Group Practice?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">One of the biggest misconceptions of a group practice is that the owner is simply receiving passive income. In most cases, this is far from the truth.</p><p id=\"\">At first, you'll probably be working more hours than you ever did in your own private practice. You'll be recruiting new therapists, refining your onboarding process, and advertising to potential clients. You may also be the one fielding intake calls and other administrative duties.</p><p id=\"\">Moreover, unless you hire an office manager, you're probably the one on the hook for managing both <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/steps-to-managing-a-client-crisis\" id=\"\">therapist and client issues</a> as they arise after hours. That's not to say you still shouldn't pursue this path. But it's paramount to be realistic with the potential workload.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Will I Cope if Things Get Messy?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Are you someone who goes with the flow and enjoys learning as you go? Or do you struggle with anxiety, micromanaging tendencies, and a heightened need for control? If a therapist quits your group practice without any advance notice, how will you cope? If you stop getting new client inquiries, how do you imagine you might respond?</p><p id=\"\">There is, of course, no perfect way to imagine what could happen. But stress is an inevitable part of all successful group practices, and all businesses have a chance of failing. It's important that you know yourself and your limitations honestly.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Do I Plan to Automate and Delegate?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In your own private therapy practice, you might manage most of your daily tasks. But when you operate a group practice, the stakes are much higher. You're only one person, and it's easy to get overwhelmed or fall into a trap of trying to do everything, even if you aren't doing those things well.</p><p id=\"\">From the beginning, starting a group practice means perceiving yourself as a leader. You're going to be managing multiple therapists and coordinating numerous therapy sessions with both old and new clients. If you intend to continue scaling, this requires even more moving parts.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Well Do I Understand My Current Competition?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In the beginning stages of starting a new group practice, it's important to be aware of the other competing therapy practices. That's not to say competition is a bad thing. There's a tremendous need for high-quality mental health services, and no one company or therapist can serve everyone.</p><p id=\"\">But it's imperative that you consider that many mental health professionals will be vying for the same clients you want. What will make your group practice different? How will you market in a way that best attracts potential clients? In addition, how can you ensure that you provide an attractive work environment for therapists seeking to work for you?</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Am I Willing to Reduce My Own Clinical Work?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">In your own solo private practice, you probably spend the bulk of your day having therapy sessions with your clients. But owning a group counseling practice is different, and some owners are surprised to find that they spend most of their <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life\" id=\"\">working time</a> focused on business management instead of client interactions.</p><p id=\"\">If you truly love your work as a therapist, you may want to reconsider what having your own group practice means. If you don't reduce your caseload, you'll be working more hours than you likely are right now. After all, owning a business means wearing many different hats, and you'll need to be as business-savvy as you are clinically-savvy.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Am I Willing to Take On More Administrative Costs?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">It's easy to get caught up in all the financial benefits associated with operating your dream practice. It's true that you may make significantly more income in running a group practice than when it's just your own business.</p><p id=\"\">But earnings only tell one part of the story. When it's your own private practice, you can generally measure profits by evaluating how many clients you see each week or month. You simply compare this to your individual operating costs or the insurance company reimbursements.</p><p id=\"\">On the business side of a group practice, you will be absorbing all the expenses associated with this larger business. There are certainly ways to save money, but you may be spending more on everything from listings on online directories to paid ads on search engines to more office space to professional development courses to legal entity fees.</p><p id=\"\">It's essential that you consider your own monetary comfort in this process. Solo practices have inherent financial risks, but these risks tend to grow exponentially once you have other clinicians working under you.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Do I Plan to Work Out of the Same Office?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">On a logistical level, geography certainly plays a role within a therapy practice. If you already see established clients in one location, there is the risk of losing them with relocation. However, your current office setup may not be large enough for multiple therapists.</p><p id=\"\">It's not uncommon for many group practices to now balance both in-person and hybrid therapy offerings. Likewise, since COVID-19, many therapists only offer remote services with no in-person sessions available.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Do I Have Mentorship?</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Most successful leaders have one thing in common: they constantly seek mentorship. They recognize their needs and limitations, and they seek out information from people more experienced than them.</p><p id=\"\">Many therapists, however, lack this clear mentorship. Instead, they strive to forge their own paths and sometimes become stubborn with their own tenacity.</p><p id=\"\">Quality mentorship can help with everything from landing more opportunities for networking, identifying blindspots, building company culture, and troubleshooting ongoing issues.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">How Navix Health Helps Group Practice Owners</strong></h2><p id=\"\">The clinical work of running a group practice can be taxing.

Failing to do so may result in working long hours, taking on more tasks, or feeling resentful toward your employers, clients, or both.</p><p id=\"\">For instance, you might decide that you stop checking your email after a certain time. Or, when you go on vacation, you leave your work phone at home.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Strengthen Your Professional Competence</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Sometimes burnout is a response to feeling insecure or incompetent in your work. Professional development can help you feel more knowledgeable.</p><p id=\"\">All licensed therapists need to maintain their clinical standing via continuing education units. But you can take it a step further by prioritizing further training or certification in areas of specialization that most resonate with you. You may find that instilling more passion helps you feel more excited about your work.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Prioritize Other Hobbies and Interests</strong></h3><p id=\"\">How do you take care of yourself after work? Therapist burnout can result in feeling too exhausted to do anything but lay around or watch TV, but it's important to try to recharge your emotional batteries. Your work should not be the sole focus of your day!</p><p id=\"\">Make a commitment to engage in meaningful activities that bring you joy- even if it's for just a few minutes a day. As tempting as it can be to \"live for the weekend,\" try to infuse these moments into your everyday life.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Implement Taking Care of Your Physical Self</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Your physical well-being affects your psychological wellness, and it's important to evaluate how well you're taking care of yourself if you're feeling burnt out.</p><p id=\"\">Prioritize staying physically active, eating nourishing foods, and getting enough sleep. If you haven't been to the doctor recently, consider scheduling a physical exam and taking blood work. Taking care of any deficiencies can improve your mood and emotional well-being.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Practice More Self-Compassion</strong></h3><p id=\"\">You may be overly hard on yourself at work, which can cause excessive stress and negative emotions. Self-compassion means practicing more self-kindness. Remember that you are a human, and you are vulnerable to emotions like everyone else.</p><p id=\"\">Self-compassion also means remembering that everyone experiences distress. You are not alone in your feelings and many other therapists can relate to feeling overwhelmed or upset with their work.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Engage In More Mindfulness</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Mindfulness doesn't fix the problems causing burnout, but it can reduce stress and help with many other mental health issues. Mindfulness gives you an opportunity to shift your perspective and try to focus on the present moment. This can help you manage stress and feel lighter during the day.</p><p id=\"\">Consider devoting just a few minutes to meditating or grounding yourself each day. Some people also find that it's helpful to spend a few moments outside or taking a walk.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Join a Peer Consultation Group</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Feeling isolated from other therapists can cause job stress and burnout. Even though therapists practice alone in treating clients, they still need group feedback, support, and relationships. If you're in private practice, this is even more important.</p><p id=\"\">Consultation groups offer professional guidance and peer support. Connecting with other mental health providers also provides a sense of validation and reassurance within the work (and that ultimately makes you a more effective therapist).</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Seek Different Supervision</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Newer therapists need ongoing training and feedback to strengthen their therapeutic effectiveness. They rely on the supervisory relationship for their professional growth.</p><p id=\"\">However, if you don't feel adequately supported by your supervisor, you may face the risk of burnout. This may be something you can work out with your supervisor directly. But if you still feel dissatisfied, you might want to consider working with someone else.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Seek Personal Therapy</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Therapists can grow immensely from seeking their own personal therapy. Getting professional help can help you prevent, understand, and treat professional burnout. Secondary trauma can coincide with burnout, and that may trigger your own mental health issues.</p><p id=\"\">It may be beneficial to work with a therapist who specializes in treating other therapists. They will understand the nuances of the work and aim to help you without turning your sessions into consultation or supervision meetings.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Delegate or Outsource Administrative Tasks</strong></h3><p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/time-management-for-busy-therapists-balancing-work-and-life\" id=\"\">Better time management</a> may help with burnout. If you have your own practice, it may be helpful to assess your administrative tasks. All these 'extras' can add extra hours to your day, and they can add more stress to your work. Is there anything you can outsource to a virtual assistant, biller, copywriter, or bookkeeper?</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Match Your Work Hours With Your Energy Levels</strong></h3><p id=\"\">If possible, try to plan your schedule in a way that best optimizes your energy. If you're a morning person, this means seeing clients early. If you're more of a night owl, it may mean prioritizing your most intensive tasks for the evening.</p><p id=\"\">Remember to schedule breaks throughout your day. It's unrealistic to expect that you'll feel energized seeing a dozen clients back-to-back. If someone no-shows, consider using that time as a way to emotionally recharge.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Talk to HR or Your Boss</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Emotional overload is real, and your burnout may be a response to having too many tasks or feeling unsupported at work. If that's the case, it's important to advocate for your own needs. Caseloads should be reasonable, and you should still have some time to recharge, learn, and connect with others.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Change Your External Environment</strong></h3><p id=\"\">Some workplaces don't accommodate a therapist's well-being. Unfortunately, your boss just might not care that you're experiencing job burnout or chronic stress. These organizations often have high rates of therapist turnover, and poor treatment inevitably affects client care as well.</p><p id=\"\">If nothing is improving, it may be worth considering if you need to switch jobs. You don't have to make this decision today, but staying in a hostile or toxic environment will erode your well-being.</p><h3 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Remind Yourself of Your Limitations</strong></h3><p id=\"\">It's important to routinely ground yourself on what is and isn't in your control. As a therapist, you can't fix all the problems in the world. You can't help if a client takes care of themselves or <a href=\"https://navixhealth.com/blogs/goal-setting-in-therapy-empowering-client-success\" id=\"\">makes progress toward their treatment goals</a>. You can't hold yourself responsible for how other people behave.</p><p id=\"\">You're responsible for your actions, boundaries, and presentation. Try to focus on what's in your control and accept what isn't.</p><h2 id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">Final Thoughts</strong></h2><p id=\"\">Many mental health professionals experience some degree of professional burnout during the course of their careers. You are not alone in your struggles.</p><p id=\"\">However, if left untreated, your job burnout symptoms can lead to serious impairment, depression, anxiety, and other problematic consequences. Remember that your own needs matter and that nobody works effectively when they're experiencing emotional or physical exhaustion.&nbsp;</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",
